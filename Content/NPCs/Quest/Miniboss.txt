Monster:

Grabs player with hands
Spawns buffed monster eyes as its killed
Jumping attack where it slams the ground?


Eye wizard:

Casts spells 
Shoots eye like ruins at the player that take up space
Uses magic bolts with very homing that applies for a second every two seconds
Shoots energy ball that bounces off of surfaces


Stitched spider:

Crawls around with legs (dan yami spider code lol)
shoots web out of its back that lands on the ground to slow the player?
Can charge towards the player really quickly
As it dies, its legs fall off until eventually it just falls to ground and becomes immobile (plays a clothes ripping sound potentially?)
