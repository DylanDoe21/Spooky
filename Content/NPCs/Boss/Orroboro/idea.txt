-orro's chasing movement should be modified, and she should have random bursts of quick movement (or charging)

-replace all the boring vanilla belch sounds with a proper shooting "hiss" sound

-boro's phase 2 telegraph acid spit should have less delay inbetween increments (currently is too long due to making it used twice per increment instead of three)

-their spit projectile should be turned into a venom fang that inflicts venom

-orro's phase 2 spread attack should shoot only one spread normally, two if enraged

-their spit projectiles during their upward curve should be replaced with small short lived bio matter, with orro shooting debuff aura biomatter and boro shooting damage aura biomatter

-add a new phase 2 attack, both orro and boro close in from the sides, then they both use a debuff and damage aura respectively (happens right before the final spin attack)

-orro should not drop acid until he is actually at the top of the screen, and he should be higher up while doing it

-boro should not summon tendrils up until he is actually at the bottom of the screen, and he should be lower while doing it


-also edit their new head sprites to have the "end" of their head higher up so it connects in game properly
