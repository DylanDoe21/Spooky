~NEW STUFF~


Raveyard Overhaul:

-The secret raveyard event that has existed in the mod for a while has been overhauled into a more fun vanity event
-Instead of being activated with disco balls, it now just has a 1 in 20 chance to occur at the beginning of each night (similarly to blood moons)
-There are no enemies during this event, but it is filled with friendly skeletons that you can talk to
-It now has revamped visuals, with cool light beams swaying back and forth in the background and a color changing skybox
-Added a new suspicious skeleton NPC who sells new strange accessories after each spooky mod boss is defeated, as well as some other things

-Like other biomes in the mod, this new biome has a bunch of new content such as weapons, accessories, armors, and a bunch of new enemies and critters
-Also has more new enemies and content in hardmode


New Town NPC, The Old Hunter:

-An ancient skeleton of a once living old hunter is scattered around the spider grotto, it's up to you to put him back together
-You can re-assemble him at a giant spider web in the spider grotto, which has a wooden template for each piece stuck on it
-After all four pieces are inserted, the web will vanish and the old hunter will be revived back to life
-He sells various different weapons (especially ranged class weapons) and some other stuff


New Main Menu Overhaul:

-Spooky mods main menu style has been completely overhauled, with an amazing new art piece by Hat in a River depicting all the main biomes and bosses
-This new menu not only looks awesome, but has a few funny little features to go along with it
-On the menu, you may notice blackened versions of each spooky mod boss. When you defeat a spooky mod boss in game, that respective will become permanently un-blackened on the menu
-Clicking the menu logo also plays a funny sound, makes the logo squish, and makes the boss outlines flash
-Completing the menu will give you a little reward on any new worlds you create

-Modified the gore armor's stat bonuses to be spread more evenly across each piece of set, since way too many stats were given by the helmets and barely any were given by the body and legs
-The flower armor's setbonus is no longer activated by double tapping down, it now has a dedicated armor bonus hotkey (This is also due to the addition of another new armor set that uses it)
