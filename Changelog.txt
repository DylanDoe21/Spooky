Update v1.0 (The catacomb update)

-This update is also the 1.0 update, as at this point spooky mod has enough content to where it can be fully played through
-This is also because spooky mod is really not work in progress anymore, and is stable enough to be played (despite the horrid multiplayer which we are still working on I promise)


~NEW STUFF~


Catacombs changes:

-TL;DR the entire catacomb has been overhauled and has recieved many improvements

-Every single room has been redone to look more unique, more detailed, and more interesting to explore
-The entirety of both layers have been redone to have new aesthetics, and their own unique blocks so they dont look exactly the same anymore
-MANY more variants of rooms have been added, as well as many changes to the catacombs generation to keep things fresh
-The catacomb generation now scales with worldsize, meaning bigger worlds will have bigger catacombs
-Big bone's boss arena has been redone completely to give you far more room during his boss fight
-Added a new arena inbetween the first and second layer of the catacombs that you fight a new boss in
-Revamped all of the old catacomb enemies with new sprites, some new AI, and moved them to be exclusive to the second layer
-Added tons of new content such as new enemies for the first layer, new weapons from both chests and enemy drops, a new hardmode armor set, and much more



New Boss, Omega Flowey:

-Ok fine it's not omega flowey but a new boss, daffodil, has been added this update
-He is an early hardmode queen slime tier boss fought in a small arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs
-Daffodil drops the red skull key now, meaning you must defeat him before you can enter the second layer
-Of course all the other goodies such as a trophy, mask, master relic and master pet have been added for daffodil




~OTHER SMALL CHANGES~

-Increased all orro & boro weapon sell prices because they were far too low
-Increased the use speed for the toilet paper and necromancy for dummies
-Increased the creepy candle's magic damage bonus to 7%
-Increased harvester's scythe knockback
-Localized big bone's spawn message because I accidentally forgot to
