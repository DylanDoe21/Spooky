~NEW STUFF~
g

New Friendly NPC, Little Eye the Alchemist:

-Has a total of four quests, each of which involve you gathering a large selection of materials to craft a special potion for him
-Upon completing a quest, you will get one monster chest food (which is basically just a chest key), and a few other rewards
-Upon completing his third quest, he will give you the cotton swab to summon moco. This is now the only way to obtain it, and the previous method has been removed entirely
-Upon completing his fourth quest he will give you the eye valley pylon, and this is also now the only way to obtain it
-After completing the four main quests, you must give him one of any mechanical boss soul, and he will then reward you with the orro & boro summon item


New Event, The Egg Incursion:

-A new endurance invasion event that takes place before you can summon orro & boro, during early hardmode
-It only needs to be completed once, afterward you will be able to summon orro & boro at any time without being forced to do it again
-However, if you die during the event then you will need to restart it again
-It will begin upon trying to break the egg with the concoction for the first time
-The event does not have an enemy kill count, and since it is an endurance event, and the progress bar increases on its own over time while you are in the valley of eyes
-There is a craftable summon item for the event you can get after orro & boro, as the enemies will drop orro & boro's crafting material after you defeat them


New Eye Valley Chest Weapons:

Flesh Mincer:
-Slow swinging and high damage axe that does even more damage to low health enemies

Seer:
-A bow that converts arrows into bloody tears, every tenth shot fires a homing eye

Retina Staff:
-Shoots controllable eyes that follow the cursor, and deal double damage when you launch them by releasing left click

Eye Lasher:
-A whip that can sometimes lower enemy defense on hit for a short time


New Biome, The Swampy Cemetery:

-A brand new biome introduced this update, it serves as the above ground biome that transitions into the catacombs
-The biome also counts as a vanilla graveyard biome, so you will no longer need to make a graveyard biome yourself to get the unique content
-This biome doesn't have much unique loot, but is meant to be more of an ambient area with some cool structures, new enemies, ect
-It also has it's own pylon, which you can buy from npcs who are happy enough in the biome


New Catacombs Visual:

-While in the catacombs your vision will be darkened, only allowing you to see a certain distance away from you
-This is to make exploring the catacombs more creepy, but also more engaging since you'll actually need to explore properly instead of just seeing what rooms are around you
-The darkness will go away during big bones fight, and will go away permanently after big bone is defeated for the first time


New Enemy, the Catacomb Guardian:

-Basically a dungeon guardian but for the catacombs, to prevent exploring it or getting loot before its intended to be found
-They will spawn in each layer of the catacombs if that layer's barrier has not been opened (does not apply to big bone's arena)
-you will be able to spawn them manually after big bone if you want to actually fight one (if you are insane)
-Defeating the catacomb guardian will give you a funny pet item


New Music:

-"The Evolution of Evil" By Rockwizard5, plays during the Egg Incursion event
-"Harvest Rainfall" By Bananalizard, plays when it rains in the Spooky Forest biome
-"A Boneyard Too Far" By Bananalizard, plays in the new Swampy Cemetery biome


New Config Options:

Spooky Forest at Spawn:
-Allows you to determine whether the spooky forest generates at your spawn point, or away from spawn
-Turn this option off to make the spooky forest generate away from spawn (Be warned, this might destroy parts of vanilla's or other mod's biomes, especially on small worlds)
-This option may also be helpful if you are playing with other mods that have worldgen at or nearby spawn

Screen Shaking Effect:
-Allows you to toggle the mod's screen shaking effects, in case you do not want it on for any reason
(For example: when rot-gourd shakes the screen after slamming the ground, or during big bone's death animation)


Other New Additions:

-Added old wood armor, old wood sword, and old wood bow
-New eye armor set, a prehardmode eye valley armor for the summon/sentry class
-New moco drop, the sneeze staff: summons flying noses that attack by flying above enemies and dropping snot balls from above that will linger if they hit the ground
