~NEW STUFF~


Raveyard Overhaul:

-The secret raveyard event that has existed in the mod for a while has been overhauled into a more fun vanity event
-Instead of being activated with disco balls, it now just has a 1 in 20 chance to occur at the beginning of each night (similarly to blood moons)
-There are no enemies during this event, but it is filled with friendly skeletons that you can talk to
-It now has revamped visuals, with cool light beams swaying back and forth in the background
-A new suspicious skeleton who sells weird items can be found here, he sells new accessories after the defeat of each spooky mod boss, and some other stuff
-Do not commit any wrong-doings infront of the bouncers


New Biome, The Spider Grotto:

-A large underground cave that has been taken over by weird spider-like creatures


New Menu Overhaul:

-Spooky mods main menu style has been completely overhauled, with an amazing new art piece by Hat in a River
-This new menu not only looks awesome, but has a few funny little features to go along with it
-On the menu, you may notice blackened versions of each spooky mod boss. When you defeat each boss in game, it will be permanently unblackened on the menu
-Clicking the menu logo also plays a funny sound and makes the boss outlines flash


Other New Additions:

-Added craftable "safe" versions of the catacomb bricks and walls you can build with, they can be shimmered into their unsafe variants after big bone is defeated




~CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT~


-The underground spooky forest cabin chests are no longer locked, and the old wood key has been removed from the mod
