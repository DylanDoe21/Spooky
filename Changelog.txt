Update v1.0 (The first full release!)

-This update is spooky mods first FULL release, which means at this point the mod has enough content and polishing that it is no longer a small WIP mod 
(Despite some of the existing multiplayer problems which we are still working on I promise)



~NEW STUFF~


Catacombs Overhaul:

-Every single room has been redone to look more unique, more detailed, and more interesting to explore overall
-Many more variants of rooms have been added, as well as many changes to the catacombs generation to keep things fresh and new in different worlds
-The entirety of both layers have been redone to have new aesthetics and their own unique blocks so they dont look exactly the same anymore
-The size of the catacombs now scales with world size, meaning bigger worlds will have bigger catacombs
-Big bone's boss arena has been redone completely to give you far more room during his fight
-Added a new arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs that you fight a new boss in
-Revamped all of the old catacomb enemies with new sprites, some new AI, and moved them to be exclusive to the second layer
-Added tons of new content such as new enemies for the first layer, new weapons obtained from both chests and enemies, and a new hardmode armor set
-Added new ambush rooms, in which groups of enemies will lock and ambush you in a room, making the catacombs a lot more fun and interesting combat wise


New Boss, Daffodil:

-She is an early hardmode queen slime tier boss fought in a small arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs
-Daffodil drops the red skull key now, meaning you must defeat her before you can enter the second layer
-She also has her own exclusive loot just as every other spooky mod boss does


Swampy Cemetery:

-The swampy cemetery biome has recieved a brand new aesthetic as the previous one was very underdeveloped and lacking in character like the other biomes
-New structures have been added, some worldgen modifications have been made to make the biome more nice looking, and new ambient tiles have been added to make it look nicer
-The swampy cemetery worldgen also now scales with world size, where bigger worlds will have a bigger cemetery biome


New Mini-Biome, The Mossy Mushroom Cave:

-New mushroom themed mini-biome found deep in the underground spooky forest, consists of glowing purple moss that can grow spooky mushrooms and spooky mushroom trees
-Contains a few new exclusive enemies, and a new material which can be used to craft a few new early game items


Egg Incursion Rework:

-The egg incursion has been reworked into an entirely new type of event that is more interesting and fun than before
-When started, it will now create a ring of darkness around the egg, only allowing you to travel a certain distance away from the egg
-The event now consists of waves of enemies that are spawned by chunks of biomass shot out of the egg, there is a total of 12 waves that each have different sets and amounts of enemies
-After you have completed the event once and defeated orro-boro for the first time, you can rematch the event again but it will be much more difficult
-The event also now has completely reworked and redesigned versions of previous enemies, as well as some new enemies that replace old ones which have been removed


The Lake of Blood and Alternate Blood Moon Fishing:

-A lake of blood has been added to the valley of eyes, which gives you an alternate way of fishing up blood moon enemies... with a twist of course
-Each of the blood lake fishing enemies are stronger and more difficult versions of vanilla's blood moon fishing enemies, with higher stats and completely new AI
-In return for the difficulty, each enemy has much higher drop rates for the blood moon fishing items, allowing you to farm them more quickly and easily
-However, you cannot fish in the lake of blood with just any fishing rod, you will need to make the goblin shark rod, which is a sentient version of the chum caster

Each enemy variant is as follows:
-Wandering Eye Fish -> Peeper fish (Prehardmode)
-Zombie Merman -> Flesh Merfolk (Prehardmode)
-Blood Squid -> Clot Squid (Has 2 variants, one that can be fished up in prehardmode, and one summoned by the claret cephalopod)
-Hemogoblin Shark -> Hemostasis Beast (Hardmode)
-Blood Eel -> Aortic Eel (Hardmode)
-Dreadnautilus -> Claret Cephalopod (Hardmode, post orro & boro)


Slingshot Sub-class:

-Slingshot weapons are now a ranger subclass in spooky mod (Sorta?)
-They use mossy pebbles as ammo, which are crafted from mossy stone in the spooky forest, or can be purchased from the merchant
-Like some vanilla ranged weapons, some slingshots can convert mossy pebbles into their own unique projectile
-The slingshots will likely be expanded more in the future, but for right now there isn't many of them, with only 3 existing in prehardmode


Config Improvements:

-Changed the color of the background, and the bars for each config option (This should hopefully help each option to stand out more, and I personally think it looks nicer)
-The screen shaking effect config is no longer an option that you turn off, it is now a slider that allows you to edit the intensity of it to your liking (More info is provided in game)


Other New Additions:

-Added bungus, chunky fungus, and mushroom hopper
-Added pumpkin putty, hopping candy basket (list all other spooky forest enemies here as they are finished)
-Added old wood greatsword, reinforced old wood bow, old wood slingshot, old wood staff, fungal flail, and spore smacker
-Added Rotty's wrath, Jerry's Book of Stinkology, Stinky Slinger, and Branch of Gourd
-Added the gilded mage armor set
-Added the bustling glowshroom
-Added the femur fracturer and idol of flame
-Added a mask and trophy for spooky spirit
-Added a bunch of new pets and light pets
-Added a bunch of new spooky mod themed angler quest fishes
-Added the unlucky horseshoe, baby rattle, and (whatever the flesh entity summon item will be)
-Added support for the 1.4.4 version of boss checklist
-Added support for Gabehaswon's music display mod


Localization File Split:

-This only applies to people who are either currently translating or want to translate the mod
-Essentially, all of the mods localization has been split up into different files for organization purposes
-Due to the way tmod gets localization, each file is named "en-US_Mods.Spooky.FileName" where en-US is the language, and FileName is the name of each specific localization file
-This means that you need to change the language infront of the file's name, like russian for example, you'd do "ru-RU_Mods.Spooky.FileName"
-Also theres a lot of new content in the mod so if you're already localizing the mod currently, you can use what you've done but you will need to put it in the correct localization file
-Hopefully the way I have organized things makes it easier for anyone trying to translate to mod, and feel free to let me know if you have questions or find any issues
