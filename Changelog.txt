~NEW STUFF~


Raveyard Overhaul:

-The secret raveyard event that has existed in the mod for a while has been overhauled into a more fun event
-Instead of being activated with disco balls, it now just has a 1 in 20 chance to occur at the beginning of each night (similarly to blood moons)
-There are no enemies during this event, but it is filled with friendly skeletons that you can talk to
-It now has revamped visuals, with cool light beams swaying back and forth in the background
-A new suspicious skeleton who sells weird items can be found here, he sells new accessories after the defeat of each spooky mod boss and other stuff


New Biome, The Spider Grotto:

-A large underground cave that was once a village has been overtaken by strange spiders and other bugs (TODO: write better description as stuff is added)




~CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT~




~BUGS AND OTHER FIXES~


-Fixed issue where you could switch to other items while using spooky mod's holdout weapons (such as the slingshots and the old hunter's crossbow)
-Fixed the chat messages for the catacomb barrier keys not being localized (they are in the dialogue localization file)
