~NEW STUFF~



New Friendly NPC, Little Eye the Alchemist:

-A little eye stalk with a wizard hat who lives in his house in the eye valley
-Has a total of four quests, each of which involve you gathering a large selection of materials to craft a special potion for him
-Upon completing a quest, you will get one monster chest food (which is basically just a chest key), and a few other rewards, as well as some unique rewards
-Upon completing his third quest, you will get the cotton swab to summon moco, and this is now the only way you can get it
-Upon completing his fourth quest, you will get the eye valley pylon, and this is now the only way you can get it
-After completing the four main quests, you must give him one of each mechanical boss soul, and he will then reward you with the acidic concoction
-After orro & boro are defeated, he will start giving you a selection of random quests you can complete in return for one sentient heart 
(sentient hearts will be explained below in the sentient weapons section)



Sentient Weapons:

-A new mechanic where you can combine certain vanilla weapons with one sentient heart at little eye's cauldron
-Sentient weapons aren't meant to be direct upgrades, but rather taking vanilla items and turning them into something a little more crazy
-Sentient weapons are not limited to one place in progression, as many different items can be upgraded
-If you are unsure, you can put a sentient heart into the guide's recipe helper to see what items can be upgraded (Not sure if it works with recipe browser, was too lazy to test it)

Sentient hearts can be obtained in three ways:
-Drops from Moco on the first time it is defeated
-Drops from Orro & Boro the first time they are defeated (Only the last worm killed will drop it)
-After Orro & Boro are defeated for the first time, little eye will give you some quests to complete (Mentioned above)



New Event, The Egg Incursion:

-A new endurance invasion event that takes place before you can summon orro & boro, it will begin upon trying to break the egg with the concoction for the first time
-It only needs to be completed once, afterward you will be able to summon orro & boro at any time without being forced to do it again
-However, if you die during the event then you will need to restart it again
-The event does not have an enemy kill count, and since it is an endurance event the progress bar increases on its own over time while you are in the valley of eyes
-There is a craftable summon item for the event you can get after orro & boro, as the enemies will drop orro & boro's crafting material after you defeat them
-The event will also last for less time if you have already completed it

Enemy list:
-Do the event in game and find out (lmao)



New Biome, The Swampy Cemetery:

-A brand new biome introduced this update, it serves as the above ground biome that transitions into the catacombs
-The biome also counts as a vanilla graveyard biome, so you will no longer need to make a graveyard biome yourself to get the unique content
-This biome doesn't have much unique loot, but is meant to be more of an ambient area with some cool structures, a few new enemies, ect
-It also has it's own pylon, which you can buy from npcs who are happy enough in the biome



An Old Friend Returns, The Spooky Spirit:

-The spooky spirit from older versions of the mod has been re-added as a boss fought in the swampy cemetery biome
-his fight is still somewhat the same, but with many improvements, new attacks, new visual effects, and improved loot



New Catacomb Darkness:

-While in the catacombs your vision will be darkened, only allowing you to see a certain distance ahead in any direction
-This makes exploring the catacombs more creepy, but also more engaging since you'll actually need to explore properly instead of just seeing what rooms are around you
-The darkness will go away during big bones fight, and will go away permanently after big bone is defeated for the first time
-This mechanic will also be very cool and good with our future plans :)



New Enemy, the Catacomb Guardian:

-Basically a dungeon guardian but for the catacombs, to prevent exploring it or getting loot before it is intended to be found
-They will spawn in each layer of the catacombs if that layer's barrier has not been opened (Does not apply to big bone's arena)
-You are not forced to fight this enemy, but it can be an optional challenge like vanilla's dungeon guardians (Or if you want to do it for the meme)



New Music:

-"The Evolution of Evil" By Rockwizard5, plays during the Egg Incursion event
-"Harvest Rainfall" By Bananalizard, plays when it rains in the Spooky Forest biome
-"A Boneyard Too Far" By Bananalizard, plays in the new Swampy Cemetery biome
-"Spooky Spirit" By Bananlizard, plays during spooky spirit's fight (This theme is currently an unfinished placeholder, the proper theme will be finished in the future)


New Config Options:

Spooky Forest at Spawn:
-Allows you to determine whether the spooky forest generates at your spawn point, or away from spawn
-Turn this option off to make the spooky forest generate away from spawn (Be warned, this might destroy parts of vanilla's or other mod's biomes, especially on small worlds)
-This option may also be helpful if you are playing with other mods that have worldgen at or nearby spawn

Screen Shaking Effect:
-Allows you to toggle the mod's screen shaking effects, in case you do not want it on for any reaso
-Was added because now a lot more stuff in the mod uses screen shaking effects
(For example, when rot-gourd shakes the screen after slamming the ground, certain weapons impacting the ground, ect)

Improved the Halloween Season Config:
-No longer requires you to leave and re-enter the world, it will now automatically be applied in game the moment you change it
-This option being turned off will not disable halloween if it is meant to normally occur in vanilla (basically during october or if you defeat the pumpkin moon's final wave)



Localization:

-This change does not really change anything gameplay wise, but it is part of tmodloader 1.4.4, and it is very helpful with localization
-Now, every single thing in spooky mod (display names, tooltips, dialogue, bestiaries, and more) is localized (As of writing this, only english localization exists in the mod)
-With tmodloader's new localization changes, anyone will now be able to translate the localization files, and send them back to me
-Once I am given back the translated localization, I can put it into the mod's files, and it will now have full support for that language



Other New Additions:

-Added old wood armor, old wood sword, and old wood bow
-Four new weapons you can get from the eye valley chests, along with craftable post-orroboro upgrades for each one
-New eye armor set, a prehardmode eye valley armor for the summon/sentry class
-New rot gourd set, a melee armor obtained after rot gourd with a nasty (And maybe broken?) set bonus
-New moco drop, the sneeze staff, which summons flying noses that attack by flying above enemies and then dropping snot balls from above that will linger if they hit the ground
-Added masks and trophies for spooky mod's bosses, each dropping from their respective boss with the same drop chances as vanilla masks and trophies
-Added new giant mushrooms to the underground spooky forest, they are placed during worldgen and can drop saplings you can plant anywhere in the spooky forest
-Added new spooky mod related tips that display at the bottom of the menu screen, they will sometimes appear along with the vanilla ones

-Rot gourd launching players upward when landing now applies to all players who are within a certain distance of him, and you won't be knocked in the air if you are far away from him
-Rot gourd no longer creates dirt debris when slamming the ground in his desperation phase as it was very spammy and unfair when combined with the flies charging at you

-All of Orro & Boro's attacks have been changed or modified to make the fight more fun, there's too many changes to list here but basically everything has been tweaked to some degree
-Orro & Boro now have an enrage mechanic where, when one worm is killed it will actually die, but the other worm will become enraged, causing it to become super aggressive
-Both Orro & Boro are now immune to the following debuffs: confused, poisoned, venom, on fire, cursed inferno, ichor, and shadow flame
