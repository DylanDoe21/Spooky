~NEW STUFF~

Brand New Biomes:

Fetid farms, a rotting vegetable garden in the underground jungle. Beware of the living vegetables, but the abandoned greenhouses have some useful new blooms in them
Tar pits, a cavern with lakes of tar in the underground desert. Filled with hostile tar slimes using fossils, along with a new block that can be extractinated for another new bloom
Krampus Workshop, a large structure in the deep underground ice biome with mass-produced dangerous toys wandering around. Interacting with krampus himself may prove useful!
Rotten Depths, an abandoned underwater study area with ruined labs. Don't let the initial quiet and peaceful atmosphere deceive you and be careful!

Amounts:
-Fetid farms (only 1 on small worlds, 2 on medium and large, and size scales with world size a little bit)
-Tar pits  (only 1 on small worlds, 2 on medium and large, and size scales with world size a little bit)
-Krampus' workshop (only 1 per world, scales with world size a lot more than the others)
-Rotten depths (only 1 per world, does not scale with worldsize due to the oceans always being the same size on all worlds)


Spooky Forest Generation Overhaul:

-Changed the spooky forests generation completely to be more natural looking and to make it more fun to explore overall
-Spooky forest underground now has entirely new cave generation to make exploring the biome more interesting and to make mining through it less annoying
-Spooky forest underground loot cabins are now randomly placed instead of only having a certain amount in set locations, which means more loot overall
-Replaced the giant crater in the spooky forest with a proper mineshaft that you can enter if you use the detonator + explosive at the surface or just dig under the explosive
-Completely new glowshroom minibiome generation because the previous one was just copy pasted glowing mushroom biome generation


New Big Bone Rework:

-Big bone has been almost entirely reworked to be a generally more fun fight, as his old fight wasnt very fun and we felt it didnt really fully expand on any interesting ideas
-Big bones attacks in general have much more unique presentation and visuals to make it more thematically interesting
-Added some new attacks, such as big bone slamming his head and causing rubble to fall from the ceiling
-Big bone has new sound effects because the old ones were just ripped from another game, the new sounds are similar to the old ones so they arent too jarring or different


New Bigger Eye Rework:

-Bigger eye now has an entirely new set of attacks because the previous fight was very rushed and not very well made
-Bigger eye now spawns with a magic tome instead of an eye orb, and when the book is damaged enough bigger eye will awaken
-He now uses this book during the fight to cast all of the spells instead of bigger eye just creating projectiles from itself


Bloom UI overhaul:

-Added new bloom UI sprites, new custom icon sprites, and more
-Bloom buffs UI is now way smaller and more compact to make it less obnoxiously big on your screen 
-Individual bloom buffs now actually display their remaining time left on the UI itself so you no longer have to guess how much time you have left for each buff


New Config Stuff:

-Spooky mods config has been split into different categories in the menu due to the addition of multiple new worldgen options to keep them organized
-Added new config category "Spooky World Generation Config" containing various options for world generation
-Moved the "Spooky Forest Spawnpoint" config option to the new spooky worldgen config category
-Added new config option "Eye Valley World Side" which uses a slider, allows you to determine what side of the world the eye valley will generate on. Options consist of: Random, Jungle Side (default), and Dungeon Side
-Added new config option "Rotten Depths World Side" which uses a slider, allows you to determine what side of the world the new rotten depths biome will generate on. Options consist of: Random, Jungle Side, and Dungeon Side (default)
