~NEW STUFF~


Eye Valley Improvements:

-Changed the terrain generation to be more rough looking, making it more interesting and natural
-Added pillars of flesh walls that generate in the biome
-Added many new ambient tiles and resprites for existing ambient tiles to make them look better
-Added many new ambient structures that spawn in the biome to make it more visually interesting
-Made eye stalk trees grow way more frequently in the biome during world generation
-Added a new giant house/lab structure where little eye lives
-Added new improved sprites for all the eye valley enemies, and re-did all of their animations to be smoother and more detailed
-Changed the behavior of some of the normal eye valley enemies to make them more interesting
-Added new red flesh variants of all the regular eye valley enemies that have different behavior from their original variants
-Added moclings


New Nose Dungeon:

-A large linear dungeon in the eye valley inhabited by strange cultists
-The entrance of the dungeon is blocked off by a locked trapdoor, which can only be opened with a shadow key
-At the beginning of the dungeon, one side is blocked by a barrier that you cannot get to until you've cleared all of the other rooms
-At the end of the dungeon, you can use the fire exit to back track to the beginning without having to go back through the spike-filled hallways
-While the actual dungeon bricks are indestructable, you can craft each occultist brick color at the creepy cauldron with one gray brick, and you can craft all the nose cultist furniture with gray occultist bricks


New Moco Rework:

-Because its fight was very old and outdated compared to every other spooky mod boss, and with the introduction of the nose dungeon, we decided to rework mocos AI to make it feel more unique and up-to-date
-To keep it a surprise, you will have to fight moco in game to find out what its like (I am also too lazy to write out mocos entire attack pattern)
-Mocos weapon drops are also no longer directly dropped directly, they are now craftable with various materials


Little Eye Quest Rework: (NOT FULLY FINISHED IN GAME YET)

-Little eye's quest system has been entirely reworked into an optional bounty system, with a new UI, and 4 new little minibosses to fight
-Each quest will have you go to each main spooky mod biome and find a miniboss which you will fight and then bring back the item it drops back to little eye for rewards
-Each miniboss also has some unique rewards they drop along with the quest item you have to turn in
-You can also now complete all 4 of the bounties in any order you like, however once you choose a specific bounty, you must complete that bounty before you can select another one
-Orro-boro is now a bounty quest, and becomes available to you after defeating all 3 mechanical bosses, after which little eye will give you the concoction
(NOTE: The orro-boro bounty is also no longer tied to the other quests, meaning you do not have to complete any of the other 4 bounties to unlock it, but you will still miss out on some unique items!)


Catacomb Improvements:

-Improved each individual catacomb room in general, they are no longer super cluttered with furniture and dont have cobwebs in them anymore to prevent inventory clutter while exploring
-Every single catacomb layer barrier has now been replaced with an unbreakable trapdoor that you open by right-clicking while you have that corresponding key in your inventory
-Changed some of the light source furniture tiles in both layers of the catacombs to make it aesthetically better and cleaner looking
-Added new moss blocks that grows on catacomb bricks, instead of there just being random clumps of swampy cemetery dirt in the catacombs
-Resprited all of the bricks, plants, and vines in the catacombs
-Giant flowers now grow naturally in the second layer of the catacombs instead of always being pre-generated in the same locations in each room
-Added a new fishing lake room and a rare secret room the the second layer
-Removed all the previous catacomb layer 2 enemies, and added a large amount of entirely new enemies, some with new gimmicks and others with improved gimmicks of old enemies
-Added fly particles to some of the coffin tiles, and removed the literal actuated poo blocks out of every catacomb room
-Daffodil's arena and big bone's arena now have new custom backgrounds, both made by Hat in a river
-You can now break blocks and use explosives in the catacombs (However, the actual brick blocks in the catacombs are still unbreakable, the rod of discord is still disabled, and you still cant place anything besides torches until after big bone is defeated)


New Bloom Farming Mechanic:

-The blooms mechanic is a farming mechanic where you can plant new "seeds" on special farmland blocks, which grow into a different plant depending on the seed type you planted
-When each plant is fully grown, they will produce one of a few different blooms that you can pick off the plant and eat
-Each individual bloom will give you a temporary bonus, with some giving you generic boosts, some giving you entirely unique abilities, and some even benefitting bloom crop growth and harvesting
-Blooms are not actually vanilla buffs, but instead have an entirely separate buff system with a special UI where their buffs show up
-This bloom buffs UI only has a limited number of slots, with 2 by default and 2 additional slots you can unlock later on after using items dropped by daffodil and big bone
-This means you can use any combination of bloom buffs that you'd like, but you can only have a limited number of them active at once, so make sure to consider which ones you want to use

Some things to note about this buff mechanic:
-Bloom buffs, like vanilla buffs, can be manually removed by right-clicking the icon of the buff you want to remove
-The UI for the bloom buffs will only show up if you have a bloom buff active and otherwise it won't show up, so don't be confused if you don't immediately see it in-game
-Bloom buffs have stacking durations, meaning if you eat multiple of the same bloom, then that blooms base duration will be added onto the remaining duration for the existing buff
(Also keep in mind that while you can do this buff duration stacking with any bloom, every single bloom buffs duration will cap at 20 minutes and it will not go beyond that even if you eat more of that bloom)


New Music:

-"Grand Sinus Corridors" by BananaLizard, plays in the new nose cultist dungeon
-"You Should Know Better" by BananaLizard, plays during the pandora's box event
-New redone version of "Graveyard without the G" by Bananalizard, and kept the old version as a legacy theme you can listen to with a vinyl purchased from music man


Config Stuff:

-Added new option "Old Hunter Dramatic Light", allows you to enable/disable the dramatic light that gets brighter over time during the old hunter's spawn animation (On by default)
-Added new option "Draggable Bloom Buff UI", allows you to choose whether or not you are able to drag the new bloom buffs UI box with your mouse (Off by default)
-Moved the "Halloween Season" option into a new separate server-side config since vanillas halloween season is not meant to be decided on a single client


Other Miscellaneous Additions:

-Added catacomb grass seeds that you can place on the craftable gray and brown catacomb bricks which will grow ambient catacomb grass, colored mushrooms, and catacomb grass vines on it
-Added item versions for some of the exclusive furniture items found in the catacombs so you can break them and take them with you
-Added compasses for the spider grotto and eye valley that point toward their respective biome while in your inventory (These compasses will sadly not work on older worlds created before this update)
-Added a few new types of zomboids that spawn during various vanilla events
-Added some new sprites for the existing spooky forest gourd tiles, added a few more gourd variants with their own unique carved faces, and made rotten gourds carvable
-Added sentient versions of the Keybrand, Venus Magnum, Proximity Mine Launcher, Leaf Blower, Magnet Sphere, Raven Staff, and Deadly Sphere Staff
