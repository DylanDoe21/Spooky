-Fixed issue where spooky forest worldgen would crash sometimes with the spooky forest at spawn config turned off

-Removed spooky mod's heavy melee weapon mechanic, and changed all of the existing items that used it, as follows:

Old Wood Greatsword: 
-Now swings normally, has high knockback

Spooky Buster: 
-Swings normally and and has a large melee swing extension visual effect
-Now only creates skulls on enemy hits as the weapon cannot strike the ground anymore
-Creates only one skull on enemy hits, the skull itself no longer damages enemies, and only the explosion it creates will damage enemies

Harvester's Scythe:
-Ability is the same, but now swings normally and has a melee swing extension visual effect

Flesh Mincer:
-Ability is the same, but now swings normally
-Has a new swing visual, but the swing visual does not actually increase the weapons range

Living Flesh Mincer:
-Has a new swing visual, but the swing visual does not actually increase the weapons range
-Now only creates eyes on enemy hits as the weapon cannot strike the ground anymore
-Reduced the amount of eyes it can create on enemy hits

Conscious Cutter:
-Not a heavy melee item, but its visual effect no longer extends the range of the blade, and it has been changed to look cooler
