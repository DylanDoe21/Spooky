~NEW STUFF~


Raveyard Overhaul:

-The secret raveyard event that has existed in the mod for a while has been overhauled into a more fun vanity event
-Instead of being activated with disco balls, it now just has a 1 in 20 chance to occur at the beginning of each night (similarly to blood moons)

-It now has revamped visuals, with cool light beams swaying back and forth in the background and a color changing skybox
-Added a new suspicious skeleton NPC who sells new strange accessories after each spooky mod boss is defeated, as well as some other things
-Do not commit any wrong-doings infront of the bouncers
