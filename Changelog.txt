~New stuff~

New spider grotto changes:
-Spider grotto caves are now way more open, giving you more room to explore and allowing for better structure placement
-Spider grotto caves are also now really flat, as the caves generation before did not work well, especially with how some of the spider grotto enemies behave 
-Added clusters of mycelium grass, which give off faint white light and grow new red mushroom trees (Because spooky mod didnt have enough mushrooms already)
-Added many block resprites, new blocks, new ambient tiles/objects, and other stuff to enhance the spider grotto's aesthetic more
-Added new old birch trees which drop ambient leaves, and have their own new wood block and furniture set

New spider grotto fog event:
-New naturally occuring weather event where fog and spores take over the grotto in hardmode
-During this event, a new set of mite enemies will begin spawning alongside the normal enemies
-The fog intensity increases over time, and when intense enough the spiders will stop spawning and only mites can be found
-Towards the end of the event, the fog intensity will decrease until the event actually ends
-Mite enemies drop a new unique material which can be used to craft lots of fun new items, and a new bloom seed
-You can also find pieces of a new armor set growing on the ground while this event is happening, and a funny new pet

New spider war event:
-New wave-based miniboss rush in the spider grotto you can do after defeating golem
-There is a total of 5 unique minibosses in the event
-Has a total of 10 waves, and the final wave will consist of an onslaught of minibosses until you get 30 kills
-Each miniboss has a trophy and other unique drops, with the drop rate being dependant on the wave (Before final wave, 10% drop chance, and during wave 10 guaranteed drops)
-The event will automatically count as complete just by making it to wave 10, so you do not have to continue past that unless you want more loot

New old hunter revamp:
-The old hunter was a lackluster town npc, and has been revamped to be more unique and also be present in hardmode, where the mod has less content
-Old hunter is now revived by finding his corpse deep in the spider grotto, and bringing back his soul which has been locked away in the lower catacombs in a certain ghostly chest
-Old hunter is no longer locked behind a poorly made scavenger hunt, and because of this the giant cobweb and all of the old hunter pieces have been removed from the mod
-Old hunter no longer moves into houses like regular town npcs, you will now need to visit him in his ruined house at the bottom of the spider grotto
-In hardmode, you can find various rare powerful enemies that spawn in the different spooky mod biomes, which each drop a special item you can give to the old hunter for unique rewards
-These special materials do not work like little eyes quests, you can just find the enemies as soon as you get into hardmode, kill them, and give the special items to the old hunter whenever you like

Dialogue Overhaul:
-The dialogue UI that was added and used for krampus in the last major update is now used across every friendly npc you can talk with in spooky mod
-Also a lot of dialogue in the mod has been re-written to be better and have interactions with your player responding to them just like with krampus

New catacombs improvements:
-The entire catacombs no longer consists of rooms that have the exact same layouts, the rooms themselves are still pre-built but all of the furniture, loot, and special rare rooms are all randomized
-Even though the individual rooms are still pre-built, there is now more than double the number of room variants as there was before, meaning the catacombs should feel a lot more natural now with less repition in room variety
-The pathways throughout the catacombs have also been made to be more random, meaning the catacombs now feels like a proper maze for players to explore instead of just exploring by running across the whole thing horizontally
-Added new upper catacomb special rooms: Art gallery rooms filled with new unique paintings, library rooms which utilize some old wood blocks, bookcases, and tables with candles
-Added new lower catacomb special rooms: Library rooms like the first layer, living quarters with small old wood rooms with various pieces of old wood furniture, and puzzle rooms with switches that open walls
-Catacomb loot chests are also now scattered around the catacombs randomly instead of the catacombs only having 4 pre-made loot rooms (Applies to both layers)
-All of the items that the old hunter used to sell are now catacomb loot chest items, some of which are in the upper catacombs and some in the lower catacombs
-Added new boulder trap and venom dart trap rooms into the catacombs because im kinda an asshole

Random New Stuff:
-Added lots of achievements to spooky mod, there are now achievements for killing each spooky mod boss, and a bunch of other ones for things like events and discovering stuff in the world (More will probably be added in the future too!)
-Added new double jump bottle and hermes boots alternatives to the underground spooky forest cabin chests to give you early game mobility (The new hermes boots alternative can also be used to craft spectre boots)
-Added some new furniture sets: Upper catacombs furniture, lower catacombs furniture, and old birch wood furniture
-Added new tall kelp plants to the rotten depths
