~NEW STUFF~

Brand New Mini-Biomes:

-Fetid farms, a nasty rotting vegetable garden found in the underground jungle (only 1 on small worlds, 2 on medium and large)
-Tar pits, a rocky desert cave with fossils and tar found in the underground desert (only 1 on small worlds, 2 on medium and large)
-Krampus' workshop, a strange dungeon structure found in the underground ice biome (only 1 per world)
-Rotten depths, an underwater cave system with old labs where an experiment has gone wrong under the ocean (only 1 per world)


Spooky Forest Generation Overhaul:

-Changed the spooky forests generation completely to be more natural looking and to make it more fun to explore overall
-Spooky forest underground now has entirely new cave generation to make exploring the biome more interesting and to make mining through it less annoying
-Spooky forest underground loot cabins are now randomly placed instead of only having a certain amount in set locations, which means more loot overall even on smaller worlds
-Replaced the giant crater in the spooky forest with a proper mineshaft that you can enter if you use the detonator + explosive at the surface or just dig under the explosive
-Completely new glowshroom minibiome generation because the previous one was just copy pasted glowing mushroom biome generation


New Config Stuff:

-Added new config category "Spooky World Generatiom Config" containing various options for world generation
-Moved the "Spooky Forest Spawnpoint" config option to this new spooky worldgen config category
-Added new config option "Eye Valley World Side" which uses a slider, allows you to determine what side of the world the eye valley will generate on. Options consist of: Random, Jungle Side (default), and Dungeon Side
-Added new config option "Rotten Depths World Side" which uses a slider, allows you to determine what side of the world the new rotten depths biome will generate on. Options consist of: Random, Jungle Side, and Dungeon Side (default)


New Music:

"T-Funk" by Bananlizard, plays in the new tar pits minibiome
"Something Smells Funky" by Bananlizard, plays in the new fetid farms minibiome
"Tapioca Motel" by Bananlizard, plays in the new krampus' workshop structure
"Where Divers Don't Dare" by Bananalizard, plays in the new rotten depths minibiome
"Neo Alkahouse" by Bananlizard, new alternate theme that plays during the raveyard


Config Additions:

-Added new spooky mod worldgen config, the existing spooky forest at spawn option has been moved to this config
-Along with the addition of the spooky mod worldgen config 2 new options have been added to it, "Eye Valley World Side" and "Rotten Depths World Side". Both of these configs are sliders allowing you to determine which side of the world these respective biomes spawn on. Each allows you to select between "Random" which randomizes the world side, "Jungle Side" which makes that respective biome always spawn on the jungle side, and "Dungeon Side" which makes that respective biome always spawn on the dungeon side of the world. Both of these configs can be edited at anytime if you have a specific preference for where they spawn, or if you are playing with other mods that add biomes in similar locations to prevent conflictions


Other Random Additions:

-Added placeable spooky forest grass walls, cemetery grass walls, and spider grotto grass walls that are sold by the dryad for 10 copper each (like vanilla grass walls)
-Added spooky dirt walls, swampy mud walls, and damp soil walls. These walls now generate in their respective biomes, and have safe versions you can craft and build with
-Added unsafe catacomb walls that can be obtained by shimmering regular catacomb walls after that respective catacomb layers boss is defeated (daffodil for layer 1 bricks, big bone for layer 2 bricks) (IMPORTANT NOTE: if you place these unsafe walls in a world where daffodil (For layer 1 walls) and big bone (For layer 2 walls) haven't been defeated, then you will NOT be able to break them until you defeat that respective boss)
-Added a couple new accessories to the underground spooky forest cabin chests, one for melee and one for ranged
-Added new raveyard vinyls for the individual tracks "Graveyard without the G" and "Neo Alkahouse"
-Added cranberry jelly and cranberry juice, functionally identical to healing potions except they auto consume when you fall below half hp and have halved potion sickness time, but heal less health
-The new cranberry jelly (pre-hardmode) and cranberry juice (hardmode) now drop from all spooky mod bosses in place of regular healing potions
