Update v1.0 (The catacomb update)

-This update is also spooky mods first FULL release, meaning at this point the mod has enough content and polish to where it is no longer a small WIP mod (despite the horrid multiplayer problems which we are still working on I promise)


~NEW STUFF~


Catacombs Changes:

-Every single room has been redone to look more unique, more detailed, and be more interesting to explore overall
-Many more variants of rooms have been added, as well as many changes to the catacombs generation to keep things fresh and new in different worlds
-The entirety of both layers have been redone to have new aesthetics and their own unique blocks so they dont look exactly the same anymore
-The size of the catacombs now scales with world size, meaning bigger worlds will have bigger catacombs
-Big bone's boss arena has been redone completely to give you far more room during his fight, making it more fair
-Added a new arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs that you fight a new boss in
-Revamped all of the old catacomb enemies with new sprites, some new AI, and moved them to be exclusive to the second layer
-Added tons of new content such as new enemies for the first layer, new weapons from both chests and enemy drops, a new hardmode armor set, and much more
-Added new ambush rooms, in which groups of enemies will lock and ambush you in a room, making the catacombs a lot more fun and interesting combat wise



New Boss, Daffodil:

-She is an early hardmode queen slime tier boss fought in a small arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs
-Daffodil drops the red skull key now, meaning you must defeat her before you can enter the second layer
-Of course she has goodies such as a trophy, mask, master relic and master pet, as well as her own weapon drops



New Mini-Biome, The Mossy Mushroom Cave:

-New mushroom themed mini biome found deep in the underground spooky forest, consists of glowing purple moss that can grow mushrooms and mushroom trees
-Contains a few new exclusive enemies, and a new material which can be used to craft various new early game items



Localization File Split:

-This only applies to people who are either currently translating or want to translate the mod
-Essentially, all of the mods localization has been split up into different files for organization purposes
-Due to the way tmod gets localization, each file is named "en-US_Mods.Spooky.FileName" where en-US is the language, and FileName is the name of each specific localization file
-This means that you need to change the language infront of the file's name, like russian for example, you'd do "ru-RU_Mods.Spooky.FileName"
-Also theres a lot of new content in the mod so if you're already localizing the mod currently, you can use what you've done but you will need to put it in the correct localization file
-Hopefully the way I have organized things makes it easier for anyone trying to translate to mod, and feel free to let me know if you have questions or find any issues



Other New Additions:

-Added old wood greatsword, reinforced old wood bow, old wood slingshot, old wood staff, shroom whip, and fungal flail
-Added Rotty's wrath, Jerry's Book of Stinkology, Stinky Slinger, and Branch of Gourd
-Added the gilded armor set
-Added giant feral rats
-Added a mask and trophy for spooky spirit
-Added three new pets, and one new light pet
-Added boss checklist support for the new 1.4.4 version




~CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT~


-The ghoslty slingshot now has it's own ammo, ghastly orbs, which are dropped by spooky spirit along with the ghostly slingshot
-The harvester's scythe now spawns souls when you hit enemies instead of needing to kill them, and you now need 10 souls in order for them to attack enemies




~OTHER SMALLER CHANGES~

-Increased all orro & boro weapon sell prices because they were far too low
-Increased the use speed for the toilet paper and necromancy for dummies
-Increased the creepy candle's magic damage bonus to 7%
-Increased harvester's scythe knockback
-Added new sprites for big bone's thorn attacks to make them look better
-Buffed the amount of defense each piece of the rotten gourd armor gives
-Rotten gourd armor now requires old wood to craft along with the rotten chunks
-Increased the drop rate for the skull scepter, warlock's cloak, and warlock's hood from zomboid warlocks
-Renamed rotten chunk to moldy chunk, because rotten chunks are already a vanilla item
-Fixed moldy chunks stacking to 999 and not stacking to 9999
-Nerfed giant tortumor contact damage from 65 to 40
-All spooky mod boss masks now drop from that bosses respective treasure bag to be consistent with vanilla

-Localized big bone's spawn message because I accidentally forgot to
