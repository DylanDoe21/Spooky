FINALLY!!!! New update changelogs so people can tell what changed!!!!

Also, if you wish to figure new features out on your own then avoid reading this, as this changelog describes every single new change and addition in detail



~Valley of Eyes Changes~

-received a full overhaul, improved generation, new sturctures and lots of new content, which are as follows

Loot:

-the items within the eye valleys chests are now entirely new items that werent in the mod before
-the chests themselves are now monster like chests instead of weird purple chests, and are now opened by feeding them monster food.

All the old chest items are now obtained in different ways, as follows:

Exposed Nerve: moved to early hardmode. there is now a rare nerve tile that grows in the biome during hardmode, break it to get the exposed nerve.
Monster Blood Vial: rarely drops from any pre-hardmode eye valley enemy.
Gore Staff: rare drop from small tortumors, and a decently common drop from giant tortumors.
Monster Heart: removed from the mod entirely.


New Friendly NPC: little eye the alchemist

little eye has 2 functions, as follows:

-has a total of 4 quests, each of which involve you gathering materials. you will get one monster chest food and other rewards for completing these.

Function 1:
-completing his final quest will give you the eye valley pylon, which is now the only way to obtain it. you can now also use it regardless of how many town npcs are nearby it.

Function 2:
-upgrades the items obtained from the new monster chests to their "sentient forms". you must have a special monster heart dropped by orroboro, along with the item you wish to upgrade in your inventory.


New Event: The Egg Incursion

-A new event that takes place before summoning orroboro.
-it only needs to be completed once. afterward you will be able to summon orroboro anytime without being forced to do it again.
-however, if you die during the event then you will need to restart it again. this means you need to do it all in one go.
-it will begin upon trying to break the egg with the concoction for the first time, and also a spooky noise indicator will play.
-the event does not have an "enemy kill count". it is an endurance event, and as such the progress bar increases on its own over time.
-it only progresses while you are in the eye valley, so you cannot just leave the biome and cheese the entire event.
-it also has a new song composed by the wonderful rockwizard!


~General Changes~


Catacomb item buffs:

due to complaints of the catacombs items basically sucking, they have all received buffs and other changes to make them more viable

Harvester's Scythe:
-damage has been buffed slightly
-use speed has been decently increased

Old Hunter's Crossbow
-damage has been buffed significantly

Rod of Ensnaring:
-damage has been buffed slightly
-mana cost has been super slightly increased

Rod of Ensnaring Projectile:
-can now pierce through a few enemies
-no longer falls to the ground, but is now somewhat short lived
-now inflicts poison on bosses for longer than regular enemies as a trade off, as bosses cannot be ensnared

Cat O' Nine Tails
-damage has been buffed slightly
-use speed has been increased slightly
-whip range has been increased significantly

Thorn Covered Bulb
-no longer bounces off of tiles, instead when it hits a tile it will fall down until it hits the floor, where it will linger for a bit before dying



New Config Option: Spooky Forest Spawnpoint

-allows you to determine whether or not the spooky forest generates at your spawn point or off to the side away from spawn
-on by default, turn it off to make the spooky forest generate away from spawn (be warned, this may destroy parts of vanilla's or other mod's biomes on small worlds)
