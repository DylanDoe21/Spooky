Important change: Enemy projectile damage fix

-Fixed an issue where all spooky mod enemy and boss projectile damage was being scaled way higher than they normally should be 
-This was a result of spooky mod not accounting for a thing in terraria where hostile projectile damage is scaled up 2x more than it should, which is accounted for in vanilla but wasn't in spooky mod
-This change basically completely rebalances all enemy projectile damage and all enemy projectile damage should now be more in-line with vanilla balance
-This means that all bosses and enemies who shoot projectiles in spooky mod will now deal the proper damage in all difficulties and wont do extremely high amounts of damage in higher difficulties
-Along with this change, a bunch of enemy and boss contact damage has been tweaked to be more balanced with vanilla
