Update v1.0 (The catacomb update)

-This update is also the 1.0 update, as at this point spooky mod has enough content to where it can be fully played through
-This is also because spooky mod is really not work in progress anymore, and is stable enough to be played (despite the horrid multiplayer which we are still working on I promise)


~NEW STUFF~


Catacombs Changes:

-Every single room has been redone to look more unique, more detailed, and be more interesting to explore
-Many more variants of rooms have been added, as well as many changes to the catacombs generation to keep things fresh in different worlds
-The entirety of both layers have been redone to have new aesthetics and their own unique blocks so they dont look exactly the same anymore
-The size of the catacombs generation now scales with world size, meaning bigger worlds will have bigger catacombs
-Big bone's boss arena has been redone completely to give you far more room and fairness during his fight
-Added a new arena inbetween the first and second layer of the catacombs that you fight a new boss in
-Revamped all of the old catacomb enemies with new sprites, some new AI, and moved them to be exclusive to the second layer
-Added tons of new content such as new enemies for the first layer, new weapons from both chests and enemy drops, a new hardmode armor set, and much more
-Added new ambush rooms, in which groups of enemies will lock and ambush you in a room, making the catacombs a lot more fun and interesting combat wise



New Boss, Daffodil:

-It is an early hardmode queen slime tier boss fought in a small arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs
-Daffodil drops the red skull key now, meaning you must defeat him before you can enter the second layer
-Of course all the other goodies such as a trophy, mask, master relic and master pet have been added for daffodil



New Mini-Biome, The Mossy Mushroom Cave:

-New mushroom themed mini biome found deep in the underground spooky forest, consists of glowing purple moss that can grow mushrooms and mushroom trees
-Contains a two new exclusive enemies, and a new material which can be used to craft various new early game items
-Keep in mind, this mini biome is basically the spooky forest equivalent of the neon moss biomes, so it is not meant to be a full expansive biome or anything



Localization File Split:

-This only applies to people who are either currently translating or want to translate the mod
-Essentially, all of the mods localization has been split up into different files for organization purposes
-Due to the way tmod gets localization, each file is named "en-US_Mods.Spooky.FileName" where en-US is the language, and FileName is the name of each specific localization file
-This means that you need to change the language infront of the file's name, like russian for example, you'd do "ru-RU_Mods.Spooky.FileName"
-Also theres a lot of new content in the mod so if you're already localizing the mod currently, you can use what you've done but you will need to put it in the correct localization file
-Hopefully the way I have organized things makes it easier for anyone trying to translate to mod, and feel free to let me know if you have questions or find any issues



Other New Additions:

-Added old wood greatsword, old wood slingshot, old wood staff, and shroom whip
-Added the gilded armor set, a new early game magic armor set
-Added giant feral rats




~CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT~


-The ghoslty slingshot now has it's own ammo, ghastly orbs, which are dropped by spooky spirit along with the ghostly slingshot




~OTHER SMALLER CHANGES~

-Increased all orro & boro weapon sell prices because they were far too low
-Increased the use speed for the toilet paper and necromancy for dummies
-Increased the creepy candle's magic damage bonus to 7%
-Increased harvester's scythe knockback
-Added new sprites for big bone's thorn attacks to make them look better
-Buffed the amount of defense each piece of the rotten gourd armor gives



~BUGS AND OTHER FIXES~

-Localized big bone's spawn message because I accidentally forgot to
