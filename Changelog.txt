~NEW STUFF~


Raveyard Overhaul:

-The secret raveyard event that has existed in the mod for a while has been overhauled into a more fun event
-Instead of being activated with disco balls, it now just has a 1 in 20 chance to occur at the beginning of each night (similarly to blood moons)
-There are no enemies during this event, but it is filled with friendly skeletons that you can talk to
-It now has revamped visuals, with cool light beams swaying back and forth in the background
-A new suspicious skeleton who sells weird items can be found here, he sells new accessories after the defeat of each spooky mod boss and other stuff


New Biome, The Spider Grotto:

-A large underground cave that was once a village has been overtaken by strange spiders and other bugs (TODO: write better description as stuff is added)


New Menu Overhaul:

-Spooky mods main menu style has been completely overhauled, with an amazing new art piece by Hat in a River
-This new menu not only looks awesome, but has a few funny little features to go along with it
-On the menu, you may notice blackened versions of each spooky mod boss. When you defeat each boss in game, it will be permanently unblackened on the menu!
-Clicking the menu logo also plays a funny sound and makes the boss outlines flash




~CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT~


-The underground spooky forest cabin chests are no longer locked, and the old wood key has been removed from the mod
-Reworked the gore monger armor set bonus, instead of giving you an aura it now summons a baby orro or boro (depending on the helmet) that will viciously attack enemies




~BUGS AND OTHER FIXES~


-Fixed issue where you could switch to other items while using spooky mod's holdout weapons (such as the slingshots and the old hunter's crossbow)
-Fixed the chat messages for the catacomb barrier keys not being localized (they are now in the dialogue localization file)
-Fixed red & purple solution not converting ash grass
