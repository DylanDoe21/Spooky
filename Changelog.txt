~New Stuff~

Spider Grotto Overhaul:
-Added many new enemies in both prehardmode and hardmode in the spider grotto
-Spider grotto caves are now way more open, giving you more room to explore and allowing for better structure placement
-Spider grotto caves are also now really flat, as the caves generation before did not work well with how some of the spider grotto enemies behaved 
-Added clusters of mycelium grass, which give off faint white light and grow new red mushroom trees (Because spooky mod didnt have enough mushrooms already)
-Added many block resprites, new blocks, new ambient tiles/objects, and other stuff to enhance the spider grotto's aesthetic more
-Added new old birch trees which drop ambient leaves, and have their own new wood block and furniture set

Spider Grotto Spore Event:
-New naturally occuring weather event where fog and spores take over the grotto in hardmode
-During this event, a new set of mite enemies will begin spawning alongside the normal enemies
-The fog intensity increases over time, and when intense enough the spiders will stop spawning and only mites can be found
-Towards the end of the event, the fog intensity will decrease until the event actually ends
-Mite enemies drop a new bloom seed and a new unique material which can be used to craft lots of fun new items
-You can also find pieces of a new armor set growing on the ground while this event is happening, and a funny new pet

Spider War Event:
-New wave-based miniboss rush in the spider grotto you can do after defeating golem
-There is a total of 5 unique minibosses in the event
-Has a total of 10 waves, and the final wave will consist of an onslaught of minibosses until you get 30 kills
-Each miniboss has a trophy and other unique drops, with the drop rate being dependant on the wave (Before final wave, 10% drop chance, and during wave 10 guaranteed drops)
-The event will automatically count as complete just by making it to wave 10, so you do not have to continue past that unless you want more loot

Old Hunter Overhaul:
-The old hunter was a lackluster town npc, and has been changed to be more unique and also be in hardmode, where the mod has less content
-Old hunter is now revived by finding his corpse in his house deep in the spider grotto, and bringing back his soul which has been locked away in the lower catacombs in a certain ghostly chest
-Old hunter is no longer locked behind a poorly made scavenger hunt, and because of this the giant cobweb and all of the old hunter pieces have been removed from the mod
-Old hunter no longer moves into houses like regular town npcs, you will now need to visit him in his ruined house at the bottom of the spider grotto
-In hardmode, you can find various rare powerful enemies that spawn in the different spooky mod biomes, which each drop a special item you can give to the old hunter for unique rewards
-These special materials do not work like little eyes quests, you can just find the enemies as soon as you get into hardmode, kill them, and give the special items to the old hunter whenever you like

Dialogue Overhaul:
-The dialogue UI that was added and used for krampus in the last major update is now used across every friendly npc you can talk with in spooky mod
-Also a lot of dialogue in the mod has been re-written to be better and have interactions with your player responding to them just like with krampus

New Catacombs Improvements:
-The entire catacombs no longer consists of rooms that have the exact same layouts, the rooms themselves are still pre-built but the furniture, loot, and special rare rooms are all randomized now
-Even though the individual rooms are still pre-built, there is now more than double the number of room variants as there was before, meaning the catacombs should feel a lot more natural now with less repition in room variety
-The pathways throughout the catacombs have also been made to be more random, meaning the catacombs now feels like a proper maze for players to explore instead of just being able to run across the whole thing horizontally
-Catacomb loot chests are also now scattered around the catacombs randomly instead of the catacombs only having 4 pre-made loot rooms (Applies to both layers)
-All of the items that the old hunter used to sell are now catacomb loot chest items, some of which are in the upper catacombs and some in the lower catacombs
-Added new upper catacomb special rooms: Art gallery rooms filled with new unique paintings, and library rooms which utilize some old wood blocks, bookcases, and tables with candles
-Added new lower catacomb special rooms: Library rooms like the first layer, living quarters with small old wood rooms with various pieces of old wood furniture, and improved puzzle rooms with switches that open walls
-Added new boulder trap and venom dart trap rooms into the catacombs because its funny

Other New Stuff:
-Added a bunch of achievements, there are now achievements for things like killing spooky mod bosses, events, getting items, discovering stuff in the world, ect (More may be added in the future as well)
-Added new sentient items to equally fill each class, which now all have the same amount of sentient items in every point of progression (3 prehardmode, 2 hardmode, and 2 post platera each)
-Added new double jump bottle and hermes boots alternatives to the underground spooky forest cabin chests to give you early game mobility (The new hermes boots alternative can also be used to craft spectre boots)
-Added eye block walls, eye bricks, eye brick walls, resprited organic mush walls to look like organic mush blocks, and added a safe version of organic mush walls you can craft and build houses with
-Added new tar pits cactus block dropped by tar pit cactuses along with a new set of weapons and armor you can craft with them
-Added raveyard monolith that allows you to activate the raveyard visual effects, and a spore monolith for the visual effects that can be seen in the new spore event
-Added some new furniture sets: Upper catacombs, lower catacombs, old birch wood
-Added spider grotto fishing crates, and a spooky forest hardmode crate
