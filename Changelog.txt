Update v1.0 (The first full release!)

-This update is spooky mod's first FULL release, which means at this point the mod has enough content and polish that it is no longer just a small WIP mod 
-While this update primarily focuses on overhauling the catacombs, lots more content has been added to fill areas of the game that spooky mod was lacking in
-Before anyone asks, YOU WILL NEED A NEW WORLD!!!! This update completely overhauls the catacombs and adds new generation to every single biome in the mod!


~NEW STUFF~


Catacombs Overhaul:

-The entirety of the catacombs has been redone to be more interesting to explore overall, and have new things to do in it
-Many more variants of rooms have been added, as well as many changes to the catacombs generation to keep things fresh and new in different worlds
-The entirety of both catacomb layers have been redone to have new aesthetics and their own unique blocks so they dont look exactly the same anymore
-The size of the catacombs now scales with world size, meaning bigger worlds will have larger catacombs
-Big bone's boss arena has been redone completely so it not only looks better, but also to give you more room to dodge and move around during his fight
-Added a new arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs that you fight a new boss in, more information about this below
-Added a new mini-event to the second layer of the catacombs, pandoras box, more information about this below
-Revamped all of the existing catacomb enemies with new sprites and some improvements to their AI, and they are now exclusive to the second layer
-Added a bunch of new enemies that spawn in the first layer of the catacombs, as well as a few new enemies for the second layer too
-Added tons of new content to the catacombs such as new chest loot, new enemy drops, a brand new early hardmode armor set, and much more


New Boss, Daffodil:

-She is an early hardmode (Queen slime tier) boss fought in a small arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs
-Daffodil drops the red skull key now, meaning you must defeat her before you can enter the second layer
-She also has her own exclusive loot just as every other spooky mod boss does


New Encounter, Pandora's Box:

-This long awaited feature has been added, that strange ghostly chest from the catacombs in older versions of the mod has made a comeback, but this time it actually does stuff!
-The pandora's box is now a mini encounter, where when interacted with, pandora's box will begin a ghoulish ambush with its own enemies, and a mini boss at the end
-Once completed, you will be rewarded with one of four unique accessories, which can also be combined together much later on in the game
-Each accessory can also be shimmered into one another, to reduce grinding


Swampy Cemetery Overhaul:

-The swampy cemetery biome has recieved a brand new aesthetic as the previous one was very underdeveloped and lacking in character like the other biomes
-New structures have been added, some worldgen modifications have been made to make the biome more nice looking, and new ambient tiles have been added
-The swampy cemetery worldgen also now scales with world size, so bigger worlds will have a bigger cemetery biome
-Added new mysterious tombstones, which you may notice with their orange outline, beaking them will yield rewards but may result in danger as well
-Also added a bunch of completely new enemies to the swampy cemetery that will make the biome more fun and a bit chaotic at times


New Mini-Biome, The Mossy Mushroom Cave:

-New mushroom themed mini-biome found deep in the underground spooky forest, consists of glowing purple moss that can grow various spooky mushrooms and spooky mushroom trees
-Contains a few new exclusive enemies, and a new material which can be used to craft a few new early game items


Egg Incursion Rework:

-The egg incursion has been reworked into an entirely new type of event that is more interesting and fun than before
-When started, it will now create a ring of darkness around the egg, only allowing you to travel a certain distance away from the egg
-The event now consists of waves of enemies that are spawned by chunks of biomass shot out of the egg, there is a total of 12 waves that each have different sets and amounts of enemies
-After you have completed the event and defeated orro-boro for the first time, you can rematch the event again, but it will be much more difficult
-The event also now has completely reworked and redesigned versions of previous enemies, as well as some new enemies that replace old ones


The Lake of Blood/Alternate Blood Moon Fishing:

-A lake of blood has been added to the valley of eyes, which gives you an alternate way of fishing up blood moon enemies, but with a twist of course
-Each of the blood lake fishing enemies are stronger and more difficult versions of vanilla's blood moon fishing enemies, with somewhat higher stats and completely new AI
-In return for the difficulty, each enemy has much higher drop rates for the blood moon fishing items, allowing you to farm them more quickly and easily, and it doesn't require a bloodmoon
-However, you cannot fish in the lake of blood with just any fishing rod, you will need to make the goblin shark rod, which requires a sentient heart and the chum caster fishing pole

Each blood moon fishing enemy variant, and when it can be fished up is as follows:
-Wandering Eye Fish -> Peeper fish (Prehardmode)
-Zombie Merman -> Flesh Merman (Prehardmode)
-Blood Squid -> Clot Squid (Has 2 variants, one that can be fished up in prehardmode, and one summoned by the dreadnautilus variant)
-Hemogoblin Shark -> Hemostasis Beast (Hardmode)
-Blood Eel -> Aortic Eel (Hardmode)
-Dreadnautilus -> Claret Cephalopod (Post Orro-Boro)


New Music:

-"Tomb Crawlin'" By Bananalizard, plays in the first layer of the catacombs


Config Improvements:

-Changed the color of the background, and the bars for each config option (This should hopefully help each option to stand out more, and I personally think it looks nicer)
-The screen shaking effect config is no longer an on and off option, it is now a slider that allows you to edit the intensity of it to your liking (More info is provided in game)


Other New Additions:

-Added tons of new enemies, critters, items, weapons, armors, but you'll have to play the update to find all these :)
-Added a mask and trophy for spooky spirit
-Added new sprites for the eye valley chest weapons and their upgrades
-Added a various new pets and light pets
-Added a bunch of new spooky mod angler quest fishes
-Added pelusa's developer vanity mask
-Added seeds for the valley of eyes grass blocks

-Added support for Gabehaswon's music display mod
