Update v1.0 (The first full release!)

-This update is spooky mods first FULL release, which means at this point the mod has enough content and polishing that it is no longer a small WIP mod 
(Despite some of the existing multiplayer problems which we are still working on I promise)



~NEW STUFF~


Catacombs Overhaul:

-Every single room has been redone to look more unique, more detailed, and be more interesting to explore overall
-Many more variants of rooms have been added, as well as many changes to the catacombs generation to keep things fresh and new in different worlds
-The entirety of both layers have been redone to have new aesthetics and their own unique blocks so they dont look exactly the same anymore
-The size of the catacombs now scales with world size, meaning bigger worlds will have bigger catacombs
-Big bone's boss arena has been redone completely to give you far more room during his fight
-Added a new arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs that you fight a new boss in
-Revamped all of the old catacomb enemies with new sprites, some new AI, and moved them to be exclusive to the second layer
-Added tons of new content such as new enemies for the first layer, new weapons obtained from both chests and enemies, and a new hardmode armor set
-Added new ambush rooms, in which groups of enemies will lock and ambush you in a room, making the catacombs a lot more fun and interesting combat wise
-The swampy cemetery worldgen also now scales with world size, bigger worlds will have a bigger cemetery biome


New Boss, Daffodil:

-She is an early hardmode queen slime tier boss fought in a small arena between the first and second layer of the catacombs
-Daffodil drops the red skull key now, meaning you must defeat her before you can enter the second layer
-She also has her own exclusive loot just as every other spooky mod boss does :)


New Mini-Biome, The Mossy Mushroom Cave:

-New mushroom themed mini biome found deep in the underground spooky forest, consists of glowing purple moss that can grow mushrooms and mushroom trees
-Contains a few new exclusive enemies, and a new material which can be used to craft various new early game items


Egg Incursion Rework:

-The egg incursion has been reworked into an entirely new type of event that is more interesting and fun than before
-When started, it will now create a ring of darkness around the egg, only allowing you to travel a certain distance away from the egg
-The event now consists of waves of enemies that are spawned by chunks of biomass shot out of the egg, there is a total of 12 waves that each have different sets and amounts of enemies
-After you have completed the event once and defeated orro-boro for the first time, you can still rematch the event again but it will be much more difficult
-The event also now has completely reworked and redesigned versions of previous enemies, as well as some new enemies that replace old ones which have been removed


Slingshot Sub-class:

-Slingshot weapons are now a ranger subclass in spooky mod (Sorta)
-They use mossy pebbles as ammo, which are crafted from mossy stone in the spooky forest, or can be purchased from the merchant
-Like some vanilla ranged weapons, certain slingshots can convert mossy pebbles into their own unique projectile
-The slingshots will likely be expanded more in the future, but for right now there isn't many of them


Config Improvements:

-Changed the color of the background, and the bars for each config option (This should hopefully help each option to stand out more)
-The screen shake config is no longer an option that you turn off, it is now a slider that allows you to edit the intensity of the effect to your liking (More info is provided in game)


Other New Additions:

-Added bungus, chunky fungus, and mushroom hoppers
-Added pumpkin putty, hopping candy basket (list all other spooky forest enemies here as they are finished)
-Added old wood greatsword, reinforced old wood bow, old wood slingshot, old wood staff, fungal flail, and spore smacker
-Added Rotty's wrath, Jerry's Book of Stinkology, Stinky Slinger, and Branch of Gourd
-Added the bustling glowshroom
-Added the femur fracturer
-Added the gilded armor set
-Added a mask and trophy for spooky spirit
-Added a bunch of new pets and light pets
-Added support for the 1.4.4 version of boss checklist


Localization File Split:

-This only applies to people who are either currently translating or want to translate the mod
-Essentially, all of the mods localization has been split up into different files for organization purposes
-Due to the way tmod gets localization, each file is named "en-US_Mods.Spooky.FileName" where en-US is the language, and FileName is the name of each specific localization file
-This means that you need to change the language infront of the file's name, like russian for example, you'd do "ru-RU_Mods.Spooky.FileName"
-Also theres a lot of new content in the mod so if you're already localizing the mod currently, you can use what you've done but you will need to put it in the correct localization file
-Hopefully the way I have organized things makes it easier for anyone trying to translate to mod, and feel free to let me know if you have questions or find any issues
