~NEW STUFF~


Raveyard Overhaul:

-The secret raveyard event that has existed in the mod for a while has been overhauled into a more fun vanity event
-Instead of being activated with disco balls, it now just has a 1 in 20 chance to occur at the beginning of each night (similarly to blood moons)
-There are no enemies during this event, but it is filled with friendly skeletons that you can talk to
-It now has revamped visuals, with cool light beams swaying back and forth in the background and a color changing skybox
-Added a new suspicious skeleton NPC who sells new strange accessories after each spooky mod boss is defeated, as well as some other things
-Do not commit any wrong-doings infront of the bouncers


New Biome, The Spider Grotto:

-A large underground cave that has been taken over by weird spider-like creatures and bugs everywhere
-This biome also has its own completely unique background (the background will not show up if you have the terraria background config turned off)
-Like other biomes in the mod, this new biome has a bunch of new content, such as weapons, accessories, armors, and a bunch of new enemies and critters
-Also has even more new content after you have defeated one mechanical boss


New Menu Overhaul:

-Spooky mods main menu style has been completely overhauled, with an amazing new art piece by Hat in a River
-This new menu not only looks awesome, but has a few funny little features to go along with it
-On the menu, you may notice blackened versions of each spooky mod boss. When you defeat each boss in game, it will be permanently unblackened on the menu
-Clicking the menu logo also plays a funny sound and makes the boss outlines flash


New Music:

-"To A Floral Demise" by BananaLizard, plays during daffodil's fight
-"It's Just Spider Stuff" by BananaLizard, plays in the new spider grotto biome
-"Graveyard Without The G" by BananaLizard and Lurak, plays during the raveyard event
-Added tweaked/updated versions of some spooky mod themes that BananaLizard wanted to improve (such as moco and orro-boro's themes)


Other New Additions:

-Added craftable "safe" versions of the catacomb bricks and walls you can build with, they can be shimmered into their unsafe variants after big bone is defeated




~CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT~


-The underground spooky forest cabin chests are no longer locked, and the old wood key has been removed from the mod
-Reworked the gore monger armor set bonus, instead of giving you an aura it now summons a baby orro or boro (depending on the helmet) that will viciously attack enemies
-Buffed every weapon/acessory you find in the spooky forest cabin chests, and catacomb chests for both layers 1 and 2
-Big bone's flower stream attack is different, in phase 1 he will make a telegraph and shoot all the roses at that spot, in phase 2 the stream of roses will follow the player like before
-Switched around big bone's skull wisp attacks, the yellow ones in phase 1 will now directly target you while the orange ones in phase 2 are now flung randomly
-Added new custom sounds for spooky spirit's charging and death, made by rockwizard
-Spooky spirit now correctly displays that it is nighttime only in it's bestiary entry
-Spirit amulet movement speed increase buffed from 15% to 20%
-Spooky mod music boxes now display the song title in color to make it more noticable and cool
-Feral rats animation speed now depends on their current movement speed instead of just playing at a constant speed
-Buffed the catacomb layer 2 enemies overall stats a bit
-Massively nerfed flourence's knockback resistance as it was way too high
-Changed sunny's bestiary description because it previously said it can use magic to summon more enemies which is a scrapped idea, and it now correctly mentions that it heals other enemies
-The toothy enemy no longer does contact damage, instead it now inflicts the player with a damage over time effect that stops as soon as the toothy is killed (or until you die)
-The flower armor's setbonus is no longer activated by double taping down, it now has a dedicated armor bonus hotkey (This is also due to the addition of another new armor that uses it)
-The flower armor's flower pot now only replaces the hermes boots running sound if it is visible on the player
-Chests in the second layer of the catacombs will now generate with adamantite/titanium bars instead of cobalt/palladium/mythril/orichalcum bars
-Spooky mod weapons that use the melee swing visual effect can now only damage 2 enemies before it stops doing damage like vanilla ones do
-Changed the spooky mod melee visual weapons to look smoother when swinging
-Buffed the spooky buster's knockback
-Sunflower rod now has a special new use animation, and buffed its use speed
-Sunflower rod projectiles now have a different after image effect as its previous one didnt look fitting
-Skull smasher and femur fracturer thrown projectiles now have after images along with their existing trail effect

-Fixed issue where you could switch to other items in your hotbar while using spooky mod's holdout weapons (such as the slingshots and the old hunter's crossbow)

-Fixed red & purple solution not converting ash grass into eye valley grass
-Fixed samson's cuff ability not working at all

-Fixed issue where spooky mod armor glowmasks weren't affected by dyes
