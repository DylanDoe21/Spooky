~NEW STUFF~


Raveyard Overhaul:

-The secret raveyard event that has existed in the mod for a while has been overhauled into a more fun event
-Instead of being activated with disco balls, it now just has a 1 in 20 chance to occur at the beginning of each night (similarly to blood moons)
-There are no enemies during this event, but it is filled with friendly skeletons that you can talk to
-It now has revamped visuals, with cool light beams swaying back and forth in the background
-A new suspicious skeleton who sells weird items can be found here, he sells new accessories after the defeat of each spooky mod boss and other stuff
