Structure helper:

-Spooky mod still uses structure helper, but as of this update structure helper is no longer a direct dependency and you no longer need to download and enable it to use spooky mod



~NEW STUFF~

Brand New Mini-Biomes:

--TODO--


Spooky Forest Generation Overhaul:

-Changed the spooky forests shape to be a more smooth looking oval
-Spooky forest underground now has entirely new cave generation to make exploring the biome more interesting and to make mining through it less annoying
-Spooky forest underground loot cabins are now randomly placed instead of only having a certain amount in set locations, which means more loot overall even on smaller worlds
-Replaced the giant crater in the spooky forest with a proper mineshaft that you can enter if you use the detonator + explosive at the surface or just dig under the explosive


Other Random Additions:

-Added spooky forest grass walls, cemetery grass walls, and spider grotto grass walls that are sold by the dryad for 10 copper each (like vanilla grass walls)
-Added unsafe catacomb walls that can be obtained by shimmering regular catacomb walls after that respective catacomb layers boss is defeated (daffodil for layer 1 bricks, big bone for layer 2 bricks)




~CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT~

-Buffed rot gourd max hp from 2200 to 2800
-Lowered drop rate of the putty slime pet
-Necronomicon volume II now shoots a bit more frequently
-Carved gourd-o-lanterns now count as light source blocks for npc houses

-Made the spider grotto biomes size a tiny bit smaller
-Rod of discord can now be used in the catacombs while fighting daffodil and big bone
-Catacombs no longer prevents you from placing blocks
-Catacomb bricks can now be broken with pickaxes once the respective boss at the bottom of that layer has been defeated (daffodil for layer 1 bricks, big bone for layer 2 bricks) (HOWEVER, the actual boss arenas and pandoras box arena are still completely indestructable. This also only applies to new worlds, in old worlds the arenas are not made out of the new unbreakable block)
-Changed daffodils death beam "hide under the platform" telegraphs to green instead of yellow to prevent confusion between her 2 different telegraphs
-Spooky biome dungeon keys now shimmer into their corresponding chest like vanilla biome keys
