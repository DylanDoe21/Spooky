If you want to figure out new features on your own, then avoid reading this, as this changelog describes all of the new changes and additions in detail

Additionally, you can scroll down to the "changes to existing stuff" category if you wish to read only changes made to existing things in the mod



~NEW STUFF~



New Friendly NPC, Little Eye the Alchemist:

-A little eye stalk with a wizard hat who lives in his house in the eye valley
-Has a total of four quests, each of which involve you gathering a large selection of materials to craft a special potion for him
-Upon completing a quest, you will get one monster chest food (which is basically just a chest key), and a few other rewards, as well as some unique rewards
-Upon completing his third quest, you will get the cotton swab to summon moco, and this is now the only way you can get it
-Upon completing his fourth quest, you will get the eye valley pylon, and this is now the only way you can get it
-After completing the four main quests, you must give him one of any mechanical boss soul, and he will then reward you with the acidic concoction

-After orro & boro are defeated, he will start giving you a selection of new random quests you can complete in return for one sentient heart 
(sentient hearts will be explained below in the sentient weapons section)



New Event, The Egg Incursion:

-A new endurance invasion event that takes place before you can summon orro & boro, it will begin upon trying to break the egg with the concoction for the first time
-It only needs to be completed once, afterward you will be able to summon orro & boro at any time without being forced to do it again
-However, if you die during the event then you will need to restart it again
-The event does not have an enemy kill count, and since it is an endurance event the progress bar increases on its own over time while you are in the valley of eyes
-There is a craftable summon item for the event you can get after orro & boro, as the enemies will drop orro & boro's crafting material after you defeat them
-The event will also last for less time if you have already completed it



New Biome, The Swampy Cemetery:

-A brand new biome introduced this update, it serves as the above ground biome that transitions into the catacombs
-The biome also counts as a vanilla graveyard biome, so you will no longer need to make a graveyard biome yourself to get the unique content
-This biome doesn't have much unique loot, but is meant to be more of an ambient area with some cool structures, new enemies, ect
-It also has it's own pylon, which you can buy from npcs who are happy enough in the biome



An Old Friend Returns, The Spooky Spirit:

-The spooky spirit from older versions of the mod has been re-added as a boss fought in the swampy cemetery biome
-his fight is still somewhat the same, but with many improvements, as well as new visual effects to make it feel more special, and improved loot



New Catacomb Mechanic, The Darkness:

-While in the catacombs your vision will be darkened, only allowing you to see a certain distance ahead
-This makes exploring the catacombs more creepy, but also more engaging since you'll actually need to explore properly instead of just seeing what rooms are around you
-The darkness will go away during big bones fight, and will go away permanently after big bone is defeated for the first time



New Enemy, the Catacomb Guardian:

-Basically a dungeon guardian but for the catacombs, to prevent exploring it or getting loot before its intended to be found
-They will spawn in each layer of the catacombs if that layer's barrier has not been opened (Does not apply to big bone's arena)
-You are not forced to fight this enemy, but it can be an optional challenge (Or if you want to do it for the meme)



New Music:

-"Harvest Rainfall" By Bananalizard, plays when it rains in the Spooky Forest biome
-"A Boneyard Too Far" By Bananalizard, plays in the new Swampy Cemetery biome
-"The Evolution of Evil" By Rockwizard5, plays during the Egg Incursion event



New Config Options:

Spooky Forest at Spawn:
-Allows you to determine whether the spooky forest generates at your spawn point, or away from spawn
-Turn this option off to make the spooky forest generate away from spawn (Be warned, this might destroy parts of vanilla's or other mod's biomes, especially on small worlds)
-This option may also be helpful if you are playing with other mods that have worldgen at or nearby spawn

Screen Shaking Effect:
-Allows you to toggle the mod's screen shaking effects, in case you do not want it on for any reaso
-Was added because now a lot more stuff in the mod uses screen shaking effects
(For example, when rot-gourd shakes the screen after slamming the ground, certain weapons impacting the ground, ect)

Redone Halloween Season Config:
-This config option existed in past versions, but has been re-written to be functionally better in game
-The halloween config no longer requires you to leave and re-enter the world, it will now automatically be applied in game the moment you change it
-The halloween config being turned off will not disable halloween if it is meant to occur in vanilla (like during october or if you defeat the pumpkin moon)



Other New Additions:

-Added old wood armor, old wood sword, and old wood bow
-New eye armor set, a prehardmode eye valley armor for the summon/sentry class
-New rot gourd set, a melee armor obtained after rot gourd with a nasty and maybe broken set bonus
-New moco drop, the sneeze staff, which summons flying noses that attack by flying above enemies and then dropping snot balls from above that will linger if they hit the ground
-Added masks and trophies for each spooky mod boss, each dropping from their respective boss with the same drop chances as vanilla masks and trophies
-Four new eye valley chest weapons, Flesh Mincer, Seer, Retina Staff, and Eye Lasher





~CHANGES TO EXISTING STUFF~
