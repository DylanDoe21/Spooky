Spider grotto rework:

New fog event:
-New naturally occuring weather event where fog and spores take over the grotto
-During this event, a new set of mite enemies will begin spawning alongside the normal enemies
-The fog intensity increases over time, and when intense enough the spiders will stop spawning and only mites can be found
-Towards the end of the event, the fog intensity will decrease until the event actually ends
-Mite enemies drop a new unique material which can be used to craft lots of fun new items
-You can also find pieces of a new armor set growing on the ground while this event is happening

New spider war event:
-New wave-based miniboss rush fought in the spider grotto post-golem
-There is a total of 5 unique minibosses in the event
-Total of 10 waves, and the final wave will consist of an onslaught of minibosses until you get 30 kills
-Each miniboss has a trophy and other unique drops, with the drop rate being dependant on the wave (Before final wave, 10% drop chance, and during wave 10 guaranteed drops)
-The event will automatically count as complete just by making it to the final wave, but you do not have to continue past that unless you want more loot

New tar pits content:
-Tar pits biome is now larger than before, but only one generates per world
-Added new unique tar pits cactus block, dropped by tar pit cactuses instead of normal cactus
(Include more info later)
