Known issues:

-Eye valley variants of the dreadnautilus and blood squid are very buggy, seemds to be due to save positions being sent and recieved
-Orro and boro segments are also kind of jittery, and boro has teleported when using its flame thrower attack
-Egg event enemies randomly deciding to vanish on hit, but its inconsistent
-Vesicator biomass spawning two enemies at once
-Big bone still vanishes on hit
