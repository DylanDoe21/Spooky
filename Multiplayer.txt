After all the content in the update is done, all multiplayer needs to be fixed the best we can


Known issues:

-Eye valley variants of the dreadnautilus and blood squid are very buggy, seemds to be due to save positions being sent and recieved
-Orroboro spawns from the egg as a head only, needs to have a custom packet
-Orro and boro segments are also kind of jittery, and boro has teleported when using its flame thrower attack
-Big bone does not spawn at all and vanishes, needs to be looked into as soon as possible
-Fix all instances of Projectile.NewProjectile spawning duplicate projectiles in every single case where this happens (especially bosses)
