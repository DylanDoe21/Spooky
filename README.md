# Spooky
The spooky mod for terraria, a halloween themed content mod with lots of goofy content.

This github is open source, and anyone is free to look through it to use it as a tool to develop their own projects.

However, you are NOT allowed to:
-Use any sprites from the mod, as that is the property of the respective aritsts who made them for the mod
-Use any of the music, as that is the property of the respective artists who made the songs for the mod

If you decide to compile the code from this github in game yourself thats totally fine, but please keep in mind that you will be spoiling all of the new content for yourself, there will be things that are unfinished, and that some planned features might not even exist yet.
