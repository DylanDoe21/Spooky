# Spooky
The spooky mod for terraria, a halloween themed content mod with lots of goofy content.

This github is open source, and anyone is free to look through it and use some code.

However, you are NOT allowed to use any of the actual assets, such as sprites and music.

If you decide to compile the code from this github in game yourself, that is fine, but please keep in mind that you will be spoiling all of the new content for yourself, as well as the fact that things are going to be unfinished, and that some planned features might not even exist yet.
