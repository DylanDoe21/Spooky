	Bounty1: I tried to make a wacky monster a while back to defend my lab from intruders and other pesky creatures that live down here. But after a few mishaps, it escaped my lab and ran off to who knows where. You should go and hunt it down... oh and bring a piece of it back for me as well!
	Bounty2: I got bored one day and ordered a weird book from Spook-bay so I could experiment with human souls. But, the guy on the website I bought it from didn't tell me that the book was full of nefarious bandits. After opening the delivery box, the book flew up to me and unleashed those trouble-makers who proceeded to cause a bunch of property damage to my lab! I think you should go and put an end to those hooligans.
	Bounty3: So a long time ago, I took up sewing as a hobby. I am actually really really good at it, because I'm usually just good at everything I do. I even used my finest and most luxurious felt I got on one of my special trips. The problem is I left it in my lab one day, and the next it was just completely gone. Do you think you could find it for me? That felt cost me a fortune!
	Bounty4: Ever tried cloning yourself? It's actually really awesome, most of the time at least. What isn't so awesome is when your clone gets praised for being powerful even though I'm the one who made it! However, I am already great, so please go fight that evil horrible thing and make sure it stays dead.
	Bounty5Locked: Defeat all three mechanical bosses to unlock the conditions for this bounty mission
	Bounty5: Ever wonder why the giant egg has a shield on it? Its kinda my fault... I got really hungry one day and went to go look for a delicious breakfast, only to find a giant egg! Well I brought the wrong spellbook with me so instead of turning it into scrambled eggs, I empowered it and put a protective barrier over it. However, I may have found a way to destroy the barrier and I need your help...

	Email2: I really didn't think it was possible, but I did it somehow. The fish revival worked and now we've got a live specimen! I caught a glimpse of it being transported from my lab, and my goodness is it big. Dont really wanna know what its like to be close to it though!

	Email5: HOLY HELL this entire underwater study is done for!! These cheap idiots couldn't be bothered to contain the specimen in a reinforced tank and now its wrecking everything. I just got the news that the zombie virus has been released and people are being infected. I've been developing a weapon in secret in case of an emergency like this but I haven't put the pieces together, and I am going to try doing it. It may be the last chance to destroy that monster.
