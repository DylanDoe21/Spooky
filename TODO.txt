Catacomb overhaul:

-new enemies, and better versions of the old enemies


Other stuff:

-have it so that the flower shot with right click directly sticks to an enemy for a duration, but it gives a MUCH higher damage bonus since you can only have one at a time

-add new ghostly slingshot ability suggestion, where when it hits an enemy it teleports around them and charges a few times
