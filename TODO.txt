The "Spookier Spooky Mod" update (part 1):

-new spooky mod menu background

new little bone mechanic: 
-you can now pick him up and carry him with you (by pressing an extra button that turns him into an item)
-little bone can be placed down and give you advice about where you are (and can help spawn certain bosses possibly?) (no promises)

-new sprites for the spooky forest ambient tiles

-candy conundrum, new "event" with trick or treat themed enemies with new weapon drops and other items

new rot-gourd mini-expansion:

rot-gourd ideas:
-rework phase 2 so rot-gourd looks beaten up, and is carried around by flies
-flies will attempt to carry rot-gourd so he can shoot at you, they can also drop rot-gourd above you, and charge at you directly

-perhaps new and more unique items from the chests (not definite)
