Catacomb overhaul:

-new catacomb rooms

-new enemies, and better versions of the old enemies

-if you win, then he wont be sleeping and you need to respawn him with fertalizer

-add in possibly new lamp tiles that are skulls with candles and more candle tiles in general for layer 2 
-possibly some ritual looking tiles involving plants 
-new giant plant ambient objects, maybe even giant tree stalks with big yellow skulls at the top to show how big bone is formed
-add in new variants of caskets and gravestones, maybe even some giant ones
