the "Creepy Catacombs" update: 

-finish catacombs chest items, and make them actually gen in the chests

-make barrier cross item have a visual cross above the player

-make big bones arena actually have a connector piece

-make proper barrier blocks for the catacombs to block off each layer

-new catacomb enemies need animations and to be implemented

-brand new items in the catacombs as well as big bone drops


The "Spookier Spooky Forest" update:

-make hopping gourd ai not horrid (and fix multiplayer)

-new spooky mod menu background

-new sprites for the spooky forest ambient tiles

-new enemies for the spooky forest

-new spooky forest underground generation (basically make the entire underground made out of stone and then replace all caves with blocks
then make unique cave generation and not just replacing blocks)

new rot-gourd mini-expansion:
-new rot-gourd sprite and design: an actual gourd, is very gray and fully/mostly rotted, and has a red evil looking face
-new rot-gourd attack improvements (if needed, not definite)
-new pumpkin patch area in the spooky forest
-pumpkin patch will have giant dead trees, custom giant jack o' lantern and gourd tiles
-new drops for rot-gourd

rot-gourd ideas:
-rework phase 2 so rot-gourd looks beaten up, and is carried around by flies
-flies will attempt to carry rot-gourd so he can shoot at you, they can also drop rot-gourd above you, and charge at you directly

new little bone mechanic: 
-you can now pick him up and carry him with you (by pressing an extra button that turns him into an item)
-little bone can be placed down and give you advice about where you are (and can help spawn certain bosses possibly?) (no promises)
-MAYBE little bone will be visible on your back and have a dialogue box in the bottom corner while in your inventory? (again, no promises)


The "Grosser Eye Valley" update:

new quest npc: 
-little eye, an eye biome version of little bone (is basically an eye in a flower pot)
-main gimmick is he gives you small quests and gives you the keys to unlock the eye biome chests as a reward for said quests

new eye valley improvements:
-new palette for the biome and all its stuff
-perhaps new and more unique items from the chests (not definite)
-new structures to make the biome look better and more fun to explore (abandoned living houses)
-orroboro rework? (no longer conventional worms) (this needs to be thought out more tbh) (also not 100% definite)


the "Ghost Circus" update:

-ghost circus mini-boss rush event, with a prehardmode and hardmode version, unique loot, ect
