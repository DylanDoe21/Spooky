The "Spookier Spooky Mod" update:

overall improves a lot of the prior content in the mod, making it less generic, without (needlessly) completely reworking it
also adding new stuff to expand on the existing stuff the mod adds

new little bone mechanic: 
-you can now pick him up and carry him with you (by pressing an extra button that turns him into an item)
-little bone can be placed down and give you advice about where you are (and can help spawn certain bosses possibly?) (no promises)
-MAYBE little bone will be visible on your back and have a dialogue box in the bottom corner while in your inventory? (again, no promises)

new quest npc: 
-little eye, an eye biome version of little bone (is basically an eye in a flower pot)
-main gimmick is he gives you small quests and gives you the keys to unlock the eye biome chests as a reward for said quests

new rot gourd mini-expansion:
-new rot gourd sprite and design: an actual gourd, is very gray and fully/mostly rotted, and has a red evil looking face
-new rot gourd attack improvements (if needed, not definite)
-new pumpkin patch area in the spooky forest
-pumpkin patch will have giant dead trees, custom giant jack o' lantern and gourd tiles, and a new special way to summon rot gourd

new eye valley improvements:
-new palette for the biome and all its stuff
-perhaps new and more unique items from the chests (not definite)
-new structures to make the biome look better and more fun to explore (abandoned living houses)
-orroboro rework? (no longer conventional worms) (this needs to be thought out more tbh) (also not 100% definite)
