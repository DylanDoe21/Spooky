Halloween/October Update:

-finish rot gourds new fight, drops, master stuff, ect

-finish new spooky forest giant dead tree that leads underground

-make new spooky underground rooms, make them deeper underground and more spread out based on world size

-new spooky gourd/pumpkin patch next to little bone's with giant rotted gourd that gives you the seed summon item

-new little bone starter house, remove the other two houses

-make little bones carry mechanic slightly different, instead he will give you a pot that you can use to just teleport him to you
(with fancy visuals of course)

-new taco enemies and critters for the spooky forest

-some new weapons for the enemies (also stuff that taco made)

fixes:

-make big bone have a longer delay after he charges to prevent certain attacks from being weird

Possible but not guaranteed:

-new spooky forest backgrounds


Halloween/October Update:

-new spooky forest backgrounds

-new sprites for the spooky forest ambient tiles

-new enemies for the spooky forest

-new moco weapons and improve the old ones

new rot-gourd mini-expansion:
-new rot-gourd sprite and design, new palette for rot-gourd and the spooky night time pumpkin enemies
-new rot-gourd attack improvements (if needed, not definite)
-new pumpkin patch areas in the spooky forest with funny little jack o lantern and gourd tiles
-new drops for rot-gourd

-new rot-gourd armor idea: the head will try to smash enemies instead of shooting boring seeds

rot-gourd ideas:
-rework phase 2 so rot-gourd looks beaten up, and is carried around by flies
-flies will attempt to carry rot-gourd so he can shoot at you, they can also drop rot-gourd above you, and charge at you directly

Stuff that might or might not happen:

-new spooky mod menu background

-new spooky forest underground generation (basically make the entire underground made out of stone and then replace all caves with blocks
then make unique cave generation and not just replacing blocks) (MAYBE???)

new little bone mechanic: 
-you can now pick him up and carry him with you (by pressing an extra button that turns him into an item)
-little bone can be placed down and give you advice about where you are (and can help spawn certain bosses possibly?) (no promises)
-MAYBE little bone will be visible on your back and have a dialogue box in the bottom corner while in your inventory? (again, no promises)


Eye Valley Update:

new quest npc:
-little eye, an eye biome version of little bone (is basically an eye in a flower pot)
-main gimmick is he gives you small quests and gives you the keys to unlock the eye biome chests as a reward for said quests

new eye valley improvements:
-new palette for the biome and all its stuff
-perhaps new and more unique items from the chests
-new structures to make the biome look better and more fun to explore (abandoned living houses)


Whatever other stuff for later:

-ghost circus mini-boss-rush event, with a prehardmode and hardmode version. will have unique loot, ect

-new bat cave mini biome with all the funny bat enemies
