Catacomb overhaul:

-new catacomb rooms

-new enemies, and better versions of the old enemies

-Make big bone found sleeping outside the flower pot, and you can talk to him to summon him
-if you die or leave the world, he goes back to sleeping
-if you win, then he wont be sleeping and you need to respawn him with fertalizer


Other stuff:

-make certain sentient weapon projectiles inflict ichor and cursed flames properly

-make rot gourd slamming more fair and not literally require a dash
