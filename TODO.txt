Catacomb overhaul:

-new catacomb rooms

-new enemies, and better versions of the old enemies

-Make big bone found sleeping outside the flower pot, and you can talk to him to summon him
-if you die or leave the world, he goes back to sleeping
-if you win, then he wont be sleeping and you need to respawn him with fertalizer

-add new root vines that can grow from the ceiling in layer 2 (cool roots with leaves on them)
-add in possibly new lamp tiles that are skulls with candles and more candle tiles in general for layer 2 
-possibly some ritual looking tiles involving plants 
-new giant plant ambient objects, maybe even giant tree stalks with big yellow skulls at the top to show how big bone is formed
-add in new variants of caskets and gravestones, maybe even some giant ones


Other stuff:

-have it so that the flower shot with right click directly sticks to an enemy for a duration, but it gives a MUCH higher damage bonus since you can only have one at a time

-add new meat giblet projectile for the sentient gatligator to shoot

-add new slingshot ability suggestion, where when it hits an enemy it teleports around them and charges a few times

-make harvesters scythe create souls on hit, and increase the number needed to 10

-add big bone sleeping infront of the flower pot

-make certain sentient weapon projectiles inflict ichor and cursed flames properly

-make rot gourd slamming more fair and not require a dash

-add better npc net updating for orro-boro segments (and anything else that needs it)
