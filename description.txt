Spooky mod is a decently sized work-in-progress mod that adds in new content with the general and more goofy theme of halloween

Currently the mod has:

-Four new biomes/areas to explore: the Spooky Forest, Valley of Eyes, Swampy Cemetery, and the Creepy Catacombs

-Five brand new bosses, and a new event, all with boss checklist support

-Tons of other usual mod content such as weapons, armor sets, and stuff like that

-Brand new soundtracks for all of the bosses and biomes

-And much more to come in the future!


Just a warning: this mod is very worldgen heavy, so playing this mod with small worlds and/or other worldgen heavy mods may cause issues or other conflictions! Don't let this discourage you from playing with mods however you like, but just be aware of potential issues!

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to hangout, we now have a discord server: [h1][url=https://discord.gg/WPNkrsxdPx] Click here to join! [/url][/h1]

Since the spooky mod now has an official discord server, and discord is generally a better place to communicate, our terraria forums page will very likely not be updated much (Unless I really feel like it)

You can also listen to and support bananalizard's soundtrack here:

You can also support the soundtrack on bandcamp, which steam won't let me link here for whatever reason, but you can find it in the discord server
