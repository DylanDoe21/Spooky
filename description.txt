Spooky mod is a work-in-progress mod that adds in a bunch of halloween themed content, such as new biomes, weapons, armors, bosses, ect.

Currently the mod has:

-Two new biomes: the Spooky Forest and the Living Hell

-Two massive new structures: the Graveyard Crypts and the Catacombs

-Three brand new bosses: Rot Gourd, Moco, and Orro-boro

-Tons of other content such as weapons, armor sets, and other various items

-Brand new soundtracks for all of the bosses, biomes, and other stuff the mod adds

-And much more to come in the future!

IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ THIS:
-While you can technically play this with other mods, this mod is VERY worldgen heavy, adding 2 new biomes and a massive structure, as well as a lot more planned worldgen in the future like new structures and mini-biomes. Playing with other large content mods will highly likely cause issues or conflicts with biomes and other world generation!
-also, playing on small worlds may not be a good idea due to the new biomes and structure this mod adds as they can possibly destroy other vanilla biomes or structures

Thanks to all of the contributers to the mod as well!
