Spooky mod is a fairly large mod that adds in new content with the general theme of halloween

Currently the mod has:

-Four new biomes and a giant underground structure to explore, all filled with new content

-Six brand new bosses, and three new events (all with boss checklist support!)

-Tons of other usual content such as weapons, armor sets, accessories, pets, enemies, blocks, and whatever else

-Banger soundtracks for all of the biomes, events, and bosses

-And more to come in the future!


Some Warnings:
-This mod is very worldgen heavy, so playing this mod with other worldgen heavy mods may cause issues or other conflictions! Don't let this discourage you from playing with other mods how you like, but just be aware of potential issues!
-It is also somewhat recommended to use medium or large worlds while playing this mod. Small worlds still work perfectly fine with spooky mod's world generation, but it may not be ideal for a playthrough with multiple people or if you are using multiple mods with lots of world generation
-Spooky mod is not currently compatible with any of terraria's secret world seeds. It may work with some seeds, but issues such as biomes generating incorrectly, world generation freezing, and crashing may happen!
-While spooky mod is mostly multiplayer compatible, there may be some issues. Multiplayer issues will continue getting fixed as the mod is worked on, and it would be greatly appreciated if any multiplayer issues you encounter are reported on either this mod's steam page or our discord server

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to hangout, we have a discord server: [h1][url=https://discord.gg/FFp7FwNBxu] Click here to join! [/url][/h1]

Since spooky mod has an official discord server, and discord is generally a better place to communicate, our terraria forums page will very likely not be updated much (Unless I really feel like it)

You can also listen to and support bananalizard's soundtrack here:

You can also support the soundtrack on bandcamp, which steam won't let me link here for whatever reason, but you can find it in the discord server
