Spooky mod is a fairly large mod that adds in new content with the general theme of halloween

Currently the mod has:

-Four new biomes and a new gigantic underground catacomb to explore

-Six brand new bosses, and three new events (all with boss checklist support!)

-Tons of other usual content such as weapons, armor sets, accessories, pets, enemies, and whatever else

-Banger soundtracks for the biomes, events, and bosses

-And more to come in the future!


Some Warnings:
-This mod is very worldgen heavy, so playing this mod with other worldgen heavy mods may cause issues or other conflictions! Don't let this discourage you from playing with other mods how you like, but just be aware of potential issues!
-It is also recommended to use medium or large worlds while playing this mod. Small worlds will still work but it may not be ideal for a playthrough, especially with multiple people or if you are using multiple mods with world generation
-While spooky mod is technically "multiplayer compatible", there are currently many issues in the mod that may affect certain features. Most things usually work but things may be unstable! I am going to continue working to fix these issues, but it may take time due to multiplayer issues sometimes being incredibly frustrating to fix, I hope you can understand, and I appreciate the patience!

Since spooky mod has an official discord server, and discord is generally a better place to communicate, our terraria forums page will very likely not be updated much (Unless I really feel like it)

You can also listen to and support bananalizard's soundtrack here:

You can also support the soundtrack on bandcamp, which steam won't let me link here for whatever reason, but you can find it in the discord server
