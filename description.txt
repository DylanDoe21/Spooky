Spooky mod is a work-in-progress mod that adds in a bunch of halloween themed content, such as new biomes, weapons, armors, bosses, ect.

Currently the mod has:

-Two new biomes: the Spooky Forest and the Living Hell

-Two massive new structures: the Graveyard Crypts and the Catacombs

-Four brand new bosses: Rot Gourd, Moco, Orro-boro, and Big Bone

-Tons of other content such as weapons, armor sets, and other various items

-Brand new soundtracks for all of the bosses and biomes

-And much more to come in the future!

IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ THIS:
-While you can technically play this with other mods, this mod is VERY worldgen heavy, adding 2 new biomes and a massive structure, as well as a lot more planned worldgen in the future like new structures and mini-biomes. Playing with other large content mods will highly likely cause issues or conflicts with biomes and other world generation!
-also, playing on small worlds may not be a good idea due to the new biomes and structure this mod adds as they can possibly destroy other vanilla biomes or structures
