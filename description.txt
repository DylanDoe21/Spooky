Spooky mod is a work-in-progress mod that adds in new content with the general theme of halloween.

Currently the mod has:

-Two new biomes: the Spooky Forest and the Valley of Eyes

-A massive new structure: the Creepy Catacombs

-Four brand new bosses, all with boss checklist support

-Tons of other content such as weapons, armor sets, and other stuff of course

-Brand new soundtracks for all of the bosses and biomes

-And much more to come in the future!

IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ THIS:
-While you can play this with other mods, this mod is VERY worldgen heavy, adding lots of big biomes and a massive structure, as well as a lot more possible planned stuff in the future. Playing with other content mods that add tons of worldgen may likely cause issues with this mod!
-Also, playing on small worlds may not be a good idea due to the new biomes and structure this mod adds as they can possibly destroy other vanilla biomes or structures
