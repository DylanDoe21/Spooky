PLEASE KEEP IN MIND: spooky mod's latest version and all future updates will ONLY be on the 1.4.4 version of tmodloader. The 1.4.3 version will NOT be updated or supported anymore.

Spooky mod is a decently large mod that adds in new content with the general theme of halloween and spookiness

Currently the mod has:

-Four new biomes/areas to explore: the Spooky Forest, Swampy Cemetery, Creepy Catacombs, and the Valley of Eyes

-Six brand new bosses, and a new event (all with boss checklist support!)

-Tons of other usual mod content such as weapons, armor sets, accessories, pets, and many other items

-Amazing new soundtracks for each biome and boss

-And more to come in the future!


Just a warning:
-This mod is very worldgen heavy, so playing this mod with other worldgen heavy mods may cause issues or other conflictions! Don't let this discourage you from playing with mods how you like, but just be aware of potential issues!
-It is also highly recommended to play with medium or large worlds while playing this mod, but small worlds will still work

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to hangout, we now have a discord server: [h1][url=https://discord.gg/FFp7FwNBxu] Click here to join! [/url][/h1]

Since the spooky mod now has an official discord server, and discord is generally a better place to communicate, our terraria forums page will very likely not be updated much (Unless I really feel like it)

You can also listen to and support bananalizard's soundtrack here:

You can also support the soundtrack on bandcamp, which steam won't let me link here for whatever reason, but you can find it in the discord server



Also, the latest update and all future versions of spooky mod will be on tmodloader 1.4.4, so make sure you are on that version
