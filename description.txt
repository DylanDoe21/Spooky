Spooky mod is a work-in-progress mod that adds in new content with the general theme of halloween and spookiness.

Currently the mod has:

-Four large biomes/areas to explore: the Spooky Forest, Valley of Eyes, Swampy Cemetery, and the Creepy Catacombs

-Four brand new bosses, all with boss checklist support

-Tons of other usual mod content such as weapons, armor sets, and stuff like that

-Brand new soundtracks for all of the bosses and biomes

-And much more to come in the future!


Just a warning: this mod is very worldgen heavy, so playing this mod with small worlds and/or other worldgen heavy mods may cause issues or other conflictions!

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to hangout, we now have a discord server: [h1][url=https://discord.gg/WPNkrsxdPx] Click here to join! [/url][/h1]

Since the spooky mod now has an official discord server, and discord is generally a better place to communicate, our terraria forums page will very likely not be updated much (Unless I really feel like it)

You can also listen to and support bananalizard's soundtrack here:

You can also support the soundtrack on bandcamp, which steam sadly won't let me link here
