PLEASE KEEP IN MIND: spooky mod's latest version and all future updates will ONLY be on the 1.4.4 version of tmodloader. Any previous versions of spooky mod on tmodloader versions before 1.4.4 will NOT be updated or supported anymore.

Spooky mod is a decently large mod that adds in new content with the general theme of halloween

Currently the mod has:

-Five new biomes/areas to explore: The Spooky Forest, Swampy Cemetery, Creepy Catacombs, Valley of Eyes, and The Spider Grotto

-Six brand new bosses, and two new events (all with boss checklist support!)

-Tons of other usual content such as weapons, armor sets, accessories, pets, and many other items

-Amazing new soundtracks for each biome and boss

-And more to come in the future!


Some Warnings:
-This mod is very worldgen heavy, so playing this mod with other worldgen heavy mods may cause issues or other conflictions! Don't let this discourage you from playing with other mods how you like, but just be aware of potential issues!
-It is also recommended to use medium or large worlds while playing this mod. Small worlds will still work but it may not be ideal for a playthrough, especially with multiple people or if you are using multiple mods with world generation

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to hangout, we have a discord server: [h1][url=https://discord.gg/FFp7FwNBxu] Click here to join! [/url][/h1]

Since spooky mod has an official discord server, and discord is generally a better place to communicate, our terraria forums page will very likely not be updated much (Unless I really feel like it)

You can also listen to and support bananalizard's soundtrack here:

You can also support the soundtrack on bandcamp, which steam won't let me link here for whatever reason, but you can find it in the discord server
