Spooky mod is a fairly large mod that adds in new content with the general theme of halloween

Currently the mod has:

-Four new biomes and a giant underground structure to explore, all filled with new content to discover
-Six brand new bosses and three new events, along with boss checklist support for all of them
-Tons of other usual content such as weapons, armor sets, accessories, pets, enemies, blocks, and whatever else
-Banger soundtracks for all of the biomes, events, and bosses
-And probably more to come in the future!


Some Warnings:
-This mod is very worldgen heavy, so playing this mod with other worldgen heavy mods may cause issues or other conflictions! Don't let this discourage you from playing with other mods how you like, but just be aware of potential issues!
-Spooky mod is not currently compatible with any of terraria's secret world seeds. It may work with some seeds, but issues such as biomes generating incorrectly, world generation freezing, and crashing may happen!
-While spooky mod is mostly multiplayer compatible, there may be still be some smaller issues. Multiplayer issues will continue getting fixed as the mod is worked on, and it would be greatly appreciated if any multiplayer issues you encounter are reported on either this mod's steam page or our discord server!
